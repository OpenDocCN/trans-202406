<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>As I sat down to work on the latest edition of <em>JavaScript Cookbook</em>, I considered the “cookbook” metaphor carefully. What makes a great food cookbook? Browsing the cookbooks on a shelf in my dining room, I noted that my favorites not only have delicious recipes, but they are also full of opinionated hard-earned advice. A cookbook rarely seeks to teach you <em>every</em> recipe for beef bourguignon; rather it teaches you the technique and recipe that the author has found works best for them, typically with a bit of advice thrown in for good measure. It’s with this concept in mind that we put together this collection of JavaScript recipes. The advice in this book comes from three seasoned pros, but it is ultimately the culmination of <em>our</em> unique experiences. Any other group of developers would have likely produced a similar, but different book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>JavaScript has developed into an amazing and powerful multipurpose programming language. With this collection in hand you will be able to solve all sorts of problems that you encounter and may even begin to develop recipes of your own.</p>&#13;

<h1>Book Audience</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To encompass the many subjects and topics reflective of JavaScript in use today, we had to start with one premise: this is not a book for someone brand new to programming. There are so many good books and tutorials for those looking to learn to program with JavaScript that we felt comfortable targeting the <em>practicing developer</em>, someone looking to solve specific problems and challenges with JavaScript.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’ve been playing around with JavaScript for several months, maybe tried your hand with a little Node or web development, you should be comfortable with the book material. Additionally, if you’re a developer who primarily works in another programming language, but find yourself needing to use JavaScript from time to time, this should be a helpful guide. Finally, if you’re a working JavaScript developer who sometimes gets stuck on some of the idiosyncrasies of the language, this should act as a useful resource.</p>&#13;

<h1>Book Organization</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are two types of readers of this book. The first is someone who reads it cover to cover, picking up tidbits of applicable knowledge along the way. The second is someone who dips their toes in as needed, seeking out the solution to a specific challenge or category of problem that they face. We attempted to organize the book in such a way that it would be useful to both types of readers, organizing it into three sections:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part01.html#part1">Part I, <em>The JavaScript Language</em></a>, covers recipes for JavaScript as a programming language.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part02.html#part2">Part II, <em>JavaScript in the Browser</em></a>, covers JavaScript in its natural habitat: the browser.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part03.html#part3">Part III, <em>Node.js</em></a>, looks at JavaScript specifically through the lens of Node.js.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each chapter of the book is broken down into several individual “recipes.” A recipe is composed of several parts:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Problem</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This defines a common development scenario where JavaScript may be used.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Solution</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>A solution to the problem, with a code sample and minimal description.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Discussion</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>An in-depth discussion of the code sample and techniques.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, a recipe may contain recommendations for further reading in a “See Also” section, or additional techniques in an “Extra” section.</p>&#13;

You may locate such pages more easily using your favorite search engine to search for a page by its name. This may also help if the page cannot be found by its address; the URL may have changed, but the name may still work.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;

<p>This is the third edition of the <em>JavaScript Cookbook</em>. The first two editions were written by Shelley Powers. This edition was written and updated by Adam Scott and Matthew MacDonald. Adam and Matthew would like to thank their editors, Angela Rufino and Jennifer Pollock, who shepherded the project through all its growing pains; and their top-shelf tech reviewers, Sarah Wachs, Schalk Neethling, and Elisabeth Robson, who offered many sharp insights and helpful suggestions. Adam would also like to thank John Paxton for his support and conversation during the early drafts of this edition.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Shelley thanks her editors, Simon St. Laurent and Brian McDonald, and her tech reviewers, Dr. Axel Rauschmayer and Semmy Purewal.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Collectively we all thank the O’Reilly production staff for their ongoing help and <span class="keep-together">support</span>.</p>&#13;
