- en: 'Kubernetes would like to thank every sysadmin who has woken up at 3 a.m. to
    restart a process. Every developer who pushed code to production only to find
    that it didn’t run like it did on their laptop. Every systems architect who mistakenly
    pointed a load test at the production server because of a leftover hostname that
    they hadn’t updated. It was the pain, the weird hours, and the weird errors that
    inspired the development of Kubernetes. In a single sentence: Kubernetes intends
    to radically simplify the task of building, deploying, and maintaining distributed
    systems. It has been inspired by decades of real-world experience building reliable
    systems, and it has been designed from the ground up to make that experience if
    not euphoric, at least pleasant. We hope you enjoy the book!'

- en: Whether you are new to distributed systems or have been deploying cloud native
    systems for years, containers and Kubernetes can help you achieve new levels of
    velocity, agility, reliability, and efficiency. This book describes the Kubernetes
    cluster orchestrator and how its tools and APIs can be used to improve the development,
    delivery, security, and maintenance of distributed applications. Though no previous
    experience with Kubernetes is assumed, to make maximal use of the book, you should
    be comfortable building and deploying server-based applications. Familiarity with
    concepts like load balancers and network storage will be useful, though not required.
    Likewise, experience with Linux, Linux containers, and Docker, though not essential,
    will help you make the most of this book.

- en: We have been involved with Kubernetes since its very beginnings. It has been
    truly remarkable to watch it transform from a curiosity largely used in experiments
    to a crucial production-grade infrastructure that powers large-scale production
    applications in varied fields, from machine learning to online services. As this
    transition occurred, it became increasingly clear that a book that captured both
    how to use the core concepts in Kubernetes and the motivations behind the development
    of those concepts would be an important contribution to the state of cloud native
    application development. We hope that in reading this book, you not only learn
    how to build reliable, scalable applications on top of Kubernetes but also receive
    insight into the core challenges of distributed systems that led to its development.

- en: The Kubernetes ecosystem has continued to grow and evolve since the first and
    second editions of this book. There have been many Kubernetes releases, and many
    more tools and patterns for using Kubernetes have become de facto standards. In
    the third edition, we focused on the addition of topics that have grown in interest
    in the Kubernetes ecosystem including security, accessing Kubernetes from programming
    languages, as well as multicluster application deployments. We also updated all
    of the existing chapters to reflect the changes and evolution in Kubernetes since
    the first and second editions. We fully expect to revise this book again in a
    few years (and look forward to doing so) as Kubernetes continues to evolve.

- en: From the first programming languages, to object-oriented programming, to the
    development of virtualization and cloud infrastructure, the history of computer
    science is a history of the development of abstractions that hide complexity and
    empower you to build ever more sophisticated applications. Despite this, the development
    of reliable, scalable applications is still dramatically more challenging than
    it ought to be. In recent years, containers and container orchestration APIs like
    Kubernetes have proven to be an important abstraction that radically simplifies
    the development of reliable, scalable distributed systems. Containers and orchestrators
    enable developers to build and deploy applications with a speed, agility, and
    reliability that would have seemed like science fiction only a few years ago.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is organized as follows. [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#introduction) outlines
    the high-level benefits of Kubernetes without diving too deeply into the details.
    If you are new to Kubernetes, this is a great place to start to understand why
    you should read the rest of the book.

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#Containers) provides a detailed introduction to containers
    and containerized application development. If you’ve never really played around
    with Docker before, this chapter will be a useful introduction. If you are already
    a Docker expert, it will likely be mostly review.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#deploying_kubernetes) covers how to deploy Kubernetes.
    While most of this book focuses on how to *use* Kubernetes, you need to get a
    cluster up and running before you start using it. Although running a cluster for
    production is outside the scope of this book, this chapter presents a couple of
    easy ways to create a cluster so that you can understand how to use Kubernetes.
    [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#common_kubectl) covers a selection of common commands used
    to interact with a Kubernetes cluster.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting with [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#pods), we dive into the details of deploying
    an application using Kubernetes. We cover Pods ([Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#pods)),
    labels and annotations ([Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#labels_and_annotations)), services
    ([Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#service_discovery)), Ingress ([Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ingress)),
    and ReplicaSets ([Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#replica_set)). These form the core basics
    of what you need to deploy your service in Kubernetes. We then cover deployments
    ([Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#deployments_chapter)), which tie together the life cycle
    of a complete application.

- en: 'After those chapters, we cover some more specialized objects in Kubernetes:
    DaemonSets ([Chapter 11](ch11.xhtml#daemon_sets)), Jobs ([Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml#jobs)),
    and ConfigMaps and Secrets ([Chapter 13](ch13.xhtml#configmaps_secrets)). While
    these chapters are essential for many production applications, if you are just
    learning Kubernetes, you can skip them and return to them later, after you gain
    more experience and expertise.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next we introduce role-based access control ([Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml#chapterbac_id))
    and cover service meshes ([Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml#service_mesh)) and integrating
    storage ([Chapter 16](ch16.xhtml#storage_k8s)) into Kubernetes. We discuss extending
    Kubernetes ([Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#extending_kubernetes)) and accessing Kubernetes
    from programming languages ([Chapter 18](ch18.xhtml#k8s_programming_languages)).
    We then focus on securing Pods ([Chapter 19](ch19.xhtml#securing_pods)) along
    with Kubernetes policy and governance ([Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml#policy_and_governance_for_kubernetes_clusters)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, we conclude with some examples of how to develop and deploy multicluster
    applications ([Chapter 21](ch21.xhtml#multi_cluster_applications)) and a discussion
    of how to organize your applications in source control ([Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#organizing_your_application)).
