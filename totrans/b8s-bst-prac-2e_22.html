&#13;
&#13;
<p>The primary strength of Kubernetes is its modularity and generality. Nearly&#13;
every kind of application that you might want to deploy you can fit within&#13;
Kubernetes, and no matter what kind of adjustments or tuning you need to&#13;
make to your system, they’re generally possible.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Of course, this modularity and generality come at a cost, and that cost is&#13;
a reasonable amount of complexity. Understanding how the APIs and&#13;
components of Kubernetes work is critical to successfully unlocking the&#13;
power of Kubernetes to make your application development, management, and&#13;
deployment easier and more reliable.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Likewise, understanding how to connect Kubernetes to a wide variety&#13;
of external systems like on-premise databases&#13;
and continuous delivery systems is critical to efficiently using Kubernetes in the real world.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout this book we have worked to provide insights from concrete, real-world&#13;
experience on specific topics that you will likely encounter whether&#13;
you are a newcomer to Kubernetes or an experienced administrator.&#13;
Regardless of whether you are facing a new area where you’re working to become&#13;
an expert, or you simply want a refresher about how others have addressed&#13;
a familiar problem, our goal is that the chapters in this book have enabled you&#13;
to learn from our experience. It is our hope that you can consult this book throughout your Kubernetes journey and quickly flick to a chapter and have a handful of best practices accessible at your fingertips.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By following these best practices, you can leverage our combined experience to help avoid common pitfalls, optimize performance and security, and quickly grow in confidence to get the most out of Kubernetes. Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you out in the real world!</p>&#13;
