- en: With the number of hours that we spend together working, it’s critical to build
    durable and long-lasting relationships with colleagues. This facilitates an understanding
    of the work an organization needs to do, and helps individuals plan for lifelong
    careers in the industry. The bedrocks of good, collaborative relationships are
    trust, empathy, and psychological safety. In this chapter, we briefly define each
    of these and explain how to foster them at work. We end with tips for how to promote
    effective, collaborative communication.

    differences. Each of us has a different cultural background with unique experiences
    that inform our choices of how and why we work. Working with, genuinely listening
    to, and imagining ourselves as the various people that we work with can help us
    break down our biases, both conscious and unconscious.

    of their health or the team’s overall productivity. Here are a few things to keep

    have a past working relationship. Swift trust, first explored by professor of
    organizational behavior Dr. Debra Meyerson,^([1](ch01.xhtml#idm45727904050680))
    occurs in short-term or short-lived teams in which trust is assumed from the beginning.
    A developer could join a new team with low trust and preconceived expectations
    of how operations generally works with development, or they could choose to adopt
    a default of trust and then verify its appropriateness based on the other team
    members’ behaviors and words. The latter is an example of swift trust.

    then you strengthen that trust as you verify the behaviors and actions of the
    individual(s) with whom you’re working. This goes hand-in-hand with swift trust,
    and works best for short-lived teams because it is focused on desired outcomes
    rather than relationships. Someone who waits until trust has already been “earned”
    before granting access to resources or responsibilities (e.g., sharing commit
    access to a project they’ve been working on) might find themselves with a chicken-or-egg
    problem: how can someone earn trust if they’re not given opportunities to earn
    trust because they aren’t yet trusted?'

    Be aware of the dangers inherent in power differentials between leadership and
    individual contributors. Guilting folks into sharing more than they are able or
    encouraging folks to trust or assume best intent without recognizing these differences
    can effectively derail the efforts being made. (You can read more about this in
    a thought-provoking article on *The Bias*.^([2](ch01.xhtml#idm45727910790392)))
    There is a balance that we must achieve when practicing self-disclosure in the
    workplace: not enough disclosure can cause others to feel uncertain, but too much
    or inappropriate disclosure can damage trust and credibility. (Camille Fournier
    has written about problems that can affect trust,^([3](ch01.xhtml#idm45727904049592))

    the requirements of their role and the process for pay increases and promotions,
    they are less likely to feel unfairly overlooked. Developing formalized roles,
    job levels, and pay scales and providing reasonable transparency in these areas
    can go a long way toward improving employee satisfaction. Another key to a perception
    of fairness is sharing risk. If two teams are sharing work or resources but only
    one will be negatively affected if their project fails, the team with more risk
    might be distrustful of the team with less risk.

    It is the feeling that an environment or team is safe enough for people to open
    up and take risks. It is what allows people to show vulnerability, to admit that
    they don’t know something, to ask a question to which they might worry that they
    “should” know the answer, and to make mistakes and talk about those mistakes openly
    rather than trying to hide them.'

    healthy communication practices. Tools such as Donut can be paired with Slack
    to facilitate remote pairing, and a variety of video chat tools can help remote

    Frequent interruptions require that time be spent repeating things that were said
    while someone else was talking, and can cause people to speak loudly simply to
    be heard. An interrupting culture tends toward competitive, rather than collaborative,
    communication. Cutting down on interrupting not only increases understanding,
    but also helps people feel that they are being heard, increasing trust and empathy.

    voicing disagreement to someone with more organizational clout than them. This

    bring a new perspective and valuable insights.

    chat for as much communication as possible and as the first choice of method,
    not a last resort. If an employee posts a question in the team’s chat room instead
    of walking over to a colleague’s desk, employees on distributed teams can learn
    and participate in discussions that they wouldn’t otherwise be part of.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A foundation of trust, empathy, and psychological safety is required to establish
    a collaborative culture and foster devops within your organization. People in
    environments that are higher-trust and more supportive overall tend to be better
    at communicating effectively. An organization in which people actively look for
    ways to support and help one another throughout the software and product development
    life cycles is an organization built on collaboration. Without team psychological
    safety, people won’t take the risk of asking the questions critical to clarifying
    goals and objectives. In [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#collaboration_in_practice), we
    look at practical ways to apply collaboration principles in the software development
    life cycle.
