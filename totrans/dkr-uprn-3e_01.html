<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is designed for anyone who needs a practical understanding of Linux containers and how they can be used to improve development and production practices. Most modern integration workflows and production systems require developers and operations engineers to have a firm understanding of Linux containers and how they can be leveraged to significantly improve repeatability and predictability across the system. Along the way we’ll explore how to build, test, deploy, and debug Linux containers within the Docker ecosystem. We’ll also cover a few of the significant orchestration tools that leverage Linux containers. And finally, we’ll round all of that out with some guidance on security and best practices for your container &#13;
<span class="keep-together">environment</span>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is intended for anyone who is looking to solve the complex workflow problems involved in developing and deploying software to production at scale. If you’re interested in Linux containers, Docker, Kubernetes, DevOps, and large, scalable, software infrastructures, then this book is for you.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why Read This Book?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Today there are many conversations, projects, and articles on the internet about Docker, and some of them have even started predicting the demise of Docker.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So why should you devote precious hours to reading this book?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Although there are other alternatives today, <a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="history of development" data-tertiary="Linux container accessibility" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171516544"/>Docker single-handedly made Linux containers accessible to all engineers. Before Docker created the container image format and helped build many of the core libraries used in containerization systems today, Linux containers were very difficult to use and primarily remained the tools of very large cloud-hosting companies that needed to provide scalability while also protecting their systems from untrusted user code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Docker changed all of that.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even though there is a lot of information about Docker and Linux containers out there, the landscape is still actively evolving, and best practices are shifting. Imagine that you just read a blog post, published four years ago, about Docker. It might still work, but it might not be the best approach anymore. During the time it took us to write the first edition of this book, Docker, Inc., released four versions of Docker plus a few major tools into their ecosystem. In the seven years between the first and third editions of this book, the landscape has changed significantly. Docker has stabilized, and there are now many additional tools that fill similar roles. Instead of suffering from a complete lack of tools, there are now many robust choices for almost every aspect of the DevOps workflow. Wrapping your arms around the scope of what Linux containers and Docker provide, understanding how they fit into your workflow, and getting all the various integrations right are not trivial tasks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We have worked with multiple companies for over nine years building and operating a mix of production Linux container platforms, including Docker, Mesos, and Kubernetes. We originally implemented Docker in production only months after its release and can share with you some of the experience we gained from evolving our production platforms since then. Our goal with this book is for you to benefit from this experience by avoiding many of the bumps in the road that we suffered through. <a data-primary="documentation" data-secondary="Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171512432"/><a data-primary="resources online" data-secondary="Docker documentation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171511456"/><a data-primary="online resources" data-see="resources online" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171496464"/><a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="documentation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171495520"/>Even though the <a href="https://docs.docker.com">online documentation for the Docker project</a> is very useful, we will attempt to give you a much bigger picture and expose you to many of the best practices that we have learned along the way.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When you finish this book, you should have enough information to understand what Linux containers are, what Docker provides, why they are important, and how you can leverage them to streamline everything from local development through production. It should be a fascinating trip through a few interesting technologies that have some very practical applications.</p>&#13;

</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We realize that many people don’t read technical books front to back and that something like the preface is incredibly easy to skip, but if you’re still with us, here is a quick guide to some different approaches to reading this book:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If you are new to Linux containers, start at the beginning. The first two chapters are intended to help you get your head around the basics of Docker and Linux containers, including what they are, how they work, and why you should care.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If you want to jump right in and install and run Docker on your workstation, then skip to Chapters <a data-type="link" href="ch03.html#installing_docker">3</a> and <a data-type="link" href="ch04.html#docker_images">4</a>, which show you how to install Docker, create and download images, run containers, and much more.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If you are familiar with the Docker basics but would like to learn more about how to utilize it for development, take a look at Chapters <a data-type="link" href="ch05.html#docker_containers">5</a> through <a data-type="link" href="ch08.html#docker_compose">8</a>, which go over a lot of the skills that will make working with Docker on a day-to-day basis easy, and conclude with a thorough exploration of Docker Compose.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If you are already using Docker for development but need some help getting it into production, consider starting with Chapter <a data-type="link" href="ch09.html#production_containers">9</a> and continuing on through Chapter <a data-type="link" href="ch12.html#expanding_landscape">12</a>. These sections delve into deploying containers, leveraging advanced container platforms, and many other advanced topics.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If you are a software or platform architect, you might find <a data-type="xref" href="ch13.html#container_thinking">Chapter 13</a> an interesting place to investigate, as we dive into some of the current thinking regarding containerized applications and horizontally scalable service design.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
