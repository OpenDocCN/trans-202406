- en: In the world of tech and cloud, several technologies are growing at an extremely
    fast pace, including multicloud, containers, Kubernetes, and DevOps. With the
    need to adopt containers and Kubernetes for running workloads as well as the capability
    to run these across on-premises and multiple clouds, we’re seeing new tools and
    technology patterns created to streamline this for technical teams. Azure Arc
    enabled Kubernetes is one of those tools, and GitOps is one of those technology
    patterns. Like the growth of cloud, containers, and Kubernetes, we’re going to
    see exponential growth of Azure Arc and GitOps. It’s only a matter of time.

    of Azure Arc and GitOps. You’ll learn what Azure Arc is, how it can be used, and
    how to use it. You’ll also learn what GitOps is and how it fits into the Azure
    Arc enabled Kubernetes offering. This report is a great first step in your journey
    with Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes and GitOps.
