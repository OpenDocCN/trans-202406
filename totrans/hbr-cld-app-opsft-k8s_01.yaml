- en: OpenShift, the Red Hat distribution of Kubernetes, is rapidly becoming the platform
    of choice for containerized applications. As enterprises attempt to scale and
    operate OpenShift, there are many practices that must be understood to manage
    resources, expose those resources for application teams, govern those resources,
    and deliver changes continuously to those environments.

- en: Based on our expertise built on managing and supporting thousands of bare metal
    and virtual machine clusters for some of the largest enterprise applications,
    we will focus on how to operationalize both basic Kubernetes and OpenShift with
    specific techniques and examples to make your organization effective.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although a lot of content exists on how to get started with Kubernetes and OpenShift,
    our goal was to focus on a book that covered more advanced concepts, such as the
    effective management of cluster resources and availability models that can be
    applied to ensure business continuity. In addition, we wanted to dig deep into
    topics, tools, and best practices that are critical to operating Kubernetes and
    OpenShift successfully in production environments. We give particular attention
    to topics like security, advanced resource management, continuous delivery, multicluster
    management, and high availability. Additionally, the book explores best practices
    for supporting hybrid cloud applications, which are applications that integrate
    the best features and functions from a combination of multiple cloud environments
    coupled with traditional IT environments. In this book, we offer our in-depth
    knowledge and experience of these production-level topics to the broader OpenShift
    and Kubernetes community.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for DevOps engineers, Kubernetes and OpenShift platform operations
    engineers, site reliability engineers, NetOps engineers, cloud native computing
    application developers, and IT architects. In addition, the book will be of particular
    interest to those who either create and manage Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters
    or consume and use these platforms for delivering applications and services.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is structured to enable operators and developers to gain a solid understanding
    of the advanced concepts required to run Kubernetes and OpenShift in production.
    [Chapter 1](ch01.html#kubernetes_and_openshift_overview) provides an overview
    of both basic Kubernetes and OpenShift. It then discusses fundamental concepts
    of Kubernetes and describes the Kubernetes architecture. In [Chapter 2](ch02.html#getting_started_with_openshift_and_kuber),
    we give a primer on the relationship between OpenShift and Kubernetes and describe
    how to get a variety of Kubernetes and OpenShift environments up and running.
    [Chapter 3](ch03.html#advanced_resource_management) is a deep dive into advanced
    resource management topics, including specialized scheduling, resource reservations,
    specialized node types, and capacity planning and management. [Chapter 4](ch04.html#single_cluster_availability)
    covers key fundamentals for supporting high availability inside a single cluster.
    In [Chapter 5](ch05.html#continuous_delivery_across_clusters), we present an overview
    of production-level approaches for continuous delivery and promotion of code across
    multiple enterprise clusters. Chapters [6](ch06.html#multicluster_fleets_provision_and_upgrad)
    and [7](ch07.html#multicluster_policy_configuration) focus on the use of multiple
    production clusters. In these chapters, we describe several hybrid cloud use cases,
    and we cover in depth such advanced topics as multicluster provisioning, upgrading,
    and policy support. These concepts are reinforced in [Chapter 8](ch08.html#working_example_of_multicluster_applicat),
    where we provide a working example of multicluster application delivery. Finally,
    in [Chapter 9](ch09.html#the_future_of_kubernetes_and_openshift) we conclude with
    a discussion of the future of Kubernetes and OpenShift and list additional references
    on a variety of helpful topics for running applications in production Kubernetes
    and OpenShift environments.

- en: We would like to thank the entire Kubernetes and OpenShift communities for their
    passion, dedication, and tremendous commitment to these open source projects.
    Without the code developers, code reviewers, documentation authors, and operators
    contributing to these projects over the years, Kubernetes and OpenShift would
    not have the rich feature sets, strong adoption, and large ecosystems they enjoy
    today.
