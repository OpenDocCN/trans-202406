<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you are a web designer or document author interested in sophisticated page styling, improved accessibility, and saving time and effort, this book is for you. All you really need to know before starting the book is HTML 4.0. The better you know HTML, the better prepared you’ll be, but it is not a requirement. You will need to know very little else to follow this book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This fifth edition of the book was finished at the end of 2022 and does its best to reflect the state of CSS at that time. Anything covered in detail either had wide browser support at the time of writing or was known to be coming soon after publication. CSS features that were still being developed or were known to have support dropping soon are not covered here.</p>&#13;

<h2>Value Syntax Conventions</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout this <a data-primary="values" data-secondary="syntax conventions" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_values_syntax_conv"/><a data-primary="syntax conventions used in this book" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_syntax_conv_pref"/>book, boxes explain a given CSS property’s details, including which values are permitted. This content has been reproduced practically verbatim from the CSS specifications, but some explanation of the syntax is in order.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The allowed values for each property are listed with a syntax like the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Value:</strong> &lt;<em><code>family-name</code></em>&gt;#</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Value:</strong> &lt;<em><code>url</code></em>&gt; ‖ &lt;<em><code>color</code></em>&gt;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Value:</strong> &lt;<em><code>url</code></em>&gt;? &lt;<em><code>color</code></em>&gt; [ / &lt;<em><code>color</code></em>&gt; ]?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Value:</strong> [ &lt;<em><code>length</code></em>&gt; | <code>thick</code> | <code>thin</code> ]{1,4}</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Value:</strong> [ &lt;<em><code>background</code></em>&gt;, ]* &lt;<em><code>background-color</code></em>&gt;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Any <a data-primary="/ (forward slash), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176139542016"/><a data-primary="forward slash (/), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115668672"/><a data-primary="slashes" data-secondary="forward slash" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115668000"/><a data-primary="&lt;…​&gt; (angle brackets), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113453296"/><a data-primary="angle brackets (&lt;…​&gt;), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115620368"/>italicized words between <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> give a type of value, or a reference to another property’s values.  For example, the property <code>font</code> accepts values that originally belong to the property <code>font-family</code>. This is denoted by using the text &lt;<em><code>font-family</code></em>&gt;.  Similarly, if a value type like a color is permitted, it will be represented using &lt;<em><code>color</code></em>&gt;.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Any words presented in <code>constant width</code> are keywords that must appear literally, without quotes. The forward slash (<code>/</code>) and the comma (,) must also be used literally.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Components of a value definition can be combined in numerous ways:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Two or more keywords strung together with only space separating them means that all of them must occur in the given order. For example, <code>help me</code> would mean that the property must use those keywords in that order.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="| (vertical bar), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176114123488"/><a data-primary="vertical bar (|), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176114122624"/>If a vertical bar separates alternatives (<em><code>X</code></em> | <em><code>Y</code></em>), any one of them must occur, but only one.  Given [ <em><code>X</code></em> | <em><code>Y</code></em> | <em><code>Z</code></em> ] any one of <em><code>X</code></em>, <em><code>Y</code></em>, or <em><code>Z</code></em> is permitted.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A <a data-primary="|| (vertical bar, double), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115616720"/><a data-primary="vertical bar, double (||), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115616128"/>vertical double bar (<em><code>X</code></em> ‖ <em><code>Y</code></em>) means that <em><code>X</code></em>, <em><code>Y</code></em>, or both must occur, but they may appear in any order.  Thus: <em><code>X</code></em>, <em><code>Y</code></em>, <em><code>X</code></em> <em><code>Y</code></em>, and <em><code>Y</code></em> <em><code>X</code></em> are all valid interpretations.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A <a data-primary="&amp;&amp; (ampersand, double), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113501344"/><a data-primary="ampersand, double (&amp;&amp;), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113500640"/>double ampersand (<em><code>X</code></em> &amp;&amp; <em><code>Y</code></em>) means both <em><code>X</code></em> and <em><code>Y</code></em> must occur, though they may appear in any order. Thus: <em><code>X</code></em> <em><code>Y</code></em> or <em><code>Y</code></em> <em><code>X</code></em> are both valid interpretations.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Brackets ([…​]) are for <a data-primary="square brackets ([…​]), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113980784"/><a data-primary="[…​] (square brackets), in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113446464"/>grouping things together.  Thus [<code>please ‖ help ‖ me</code>] <code>do this</code> means that the words <code>please</code>, <code>help</code>, and <code>me</code> can appear in any order, though each appear only once. The words <code>do this</code> must always appear, in that order.  Here are some examples: <code>please help me do this</code>, <code>help me please do this</code>, <code>me please help do this</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Every component or bracketed group may (or may not) be followed by one of these &#13;
<span class="keep-together">modifiers:</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>An <a data-primary="* (asterisk)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115656752"/><a data-primary="asterisk (*)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115655504"/>asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated zero or more times. Thus, <code>bucket</code>* means that the word <code>bucket</code> can be used any number of times, including zero. There is no upper limit defined on the number of times it can be used.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A <a data-primary="+ (plus sign)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176139492272"/><a data-primary="plus sign (+)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115645040"/>plus (+) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated one or more times. Thus, <code>mop</code>+ means that the word <code>mop</code> must be used at least once, and potentially many more times.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A <a data-primary="# (octothorpe)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115649760"/><a data-primary="hash mark (#)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176119381648"/><a data-primary="number sign (#)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176114102768"/><a data-primary="octothorpe (#)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176114101552"/><a data-primary="pound sign (#)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115948432"/>hash sign (#), formally called an octothorpe, indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated one or more times, separated by commas as needed.  Thus, <code>floor</code># can be <code>floor</code> or <code>floor, floor, floor</code>, and so on.  This is most often used in conjunction with bracketed groups or value types.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A <a data-primary="question mark (?), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176162206656"/><a data-primary="? (question mark), in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176162205952"/>question mark (?) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is optional. For example, [<code>pine tree</code>]? means that the words <code>pine tree</code> need not be used (although they must appear in that order if they are used).</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>An <a data-primary="! (exclamation point)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115621344"/><a data-primary="exclamation point (!)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113941728"/>exclamation point (!) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is required, and thus must result in at least one value, even if the syntax would seem to indicate otherwise.  For example, [ <code>what</code>? <code>is</code>? <code>happening</code>? ]! must be at least one of the three terms marked optional.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A pair of numbers in <a data-primary="{…​} (curly braces)" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176114124880"/><a data-primary="curly braces ({…​})" data-secondary="in value syntax" data-secondary-sortas="value syntax" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176115780144"/>curly braces ({<em>M</em>,<em>N</em>}) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated at least <em>M</em> and at most <em>N</em> times. For example, <code>ha</code>{1,3} means that there can be one, two, or three instances of the word <code>ha</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">The following are some examples:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt><span class="dt_plain"><code>give</code> ‖ <code>me</code> ‖ <code>liberty</code></span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>At least one of the three words must be used, and they can be used in any order. For example, <code>give liberty</code>, <code>give me</code>, <code>liberty me give</code>, and <code>give me liberty</code> are all valid interpretations.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><span class="dt_plain">[ <code>I</code> | <code>am</code> ]? <code>the</code> ‖ <code>walrus</code></span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Either the word <code>I</code> or <code>am</code> may be used, but not both, and use of either is optional. In addition, either <code>the</code> or <code>walrus</code>, or both, must follow in any order. Thus you could construct <code>I the walrus</code>, <code>am walrus the</code>, <code>am the</code>, <code>I walrus</code>, <code>walrus the</code>, and so forth.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><span class="dt_plain"><code>koo</code>+ <code>ka-choo</code></span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>One or more instances of <code>koo</code> must be followed by <code>ka-choo</code>. Therefore <code>koo koo ka-choo</code>, <code>koo koo koo ka-choo</code>, and <code>koo ka-choo</code> are all legal. The number of <code>koo</code>s is potentially infinite, although there are bound to be implementation-specific limits.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><span class="dt_plain"><code>I really</code>{1,4}? [ <code>love</code> | <code>hate</code> ] [ <code>Microsoft</code> | <code>Firefox</code> | <code>Opera</code> | <code>Safari</code> | <code>Chrome</code> ]</span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The all-purpose web designer’s opinion expresser. This can be interpreted as <code>I love Firefox</code>, <code>I really love Microsoft</code>, and similar expressions. Anywhere from zero to four <code>really</code>s may be used, though they may <em>not</em> be separated by commas. You also get to pick between <code>love</code> and <code>hate</code>, which really seems like some sort of metaphor.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><span class="dt_plain"><code>It’s a</code> [ <code>mad</code> ]# <code>world</code></span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This gives the opportunity to put in as many comma-separated <code>mad</code>s as possible, with a minimum of one <code>mad</code>. If there is only one <code>mad</code>, no comma is added.  Thus: <code>It’s a mad world</code> and <code>It’s a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world</code> are both valid results.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><span class="dt_plain">[ [ <code>Alpha</code> ‖ <code>Baker</code> ‖ <code>Cray</code> ], ]{2,3} <code>and Delphi</code></span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Two to three of <code>Alpha</code>, <code>Baker</code>, and <code>Delta</code> must be followed by <code>and Delphi</code>.  One possible result would be <code>Cray, Alpha, and Delphi</code>. In this case, the comma is placed because of its position within the nested bracket groups.  (Some older versions of CSS enforced comma separation this way, instead of via the <code>#</code> modifier.)<a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_syntax_conv_pref" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113810144"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="ix_values_syntax_conv" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45176113809136"/></p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>First, I want to thank all the technical reviewers of this edition, who lent their time and expertise to the arduous task of finding out all the places I’d been wrong, and for less recompense than they deserved.  Alphabetically, by family name: Ire Aderinokun, Rachel Andrew, Adam Argyle, Amelia Bellamy-Royds, Chen Hui Jing, Stephanie Eckles, Eva &#13;
<span class="keep-together">Ferreira,</span> Mandy Michael, Schalk Neethling, Jason Pamental, Janelle Pizarro, Eric Portis, Miriam Suzanne, Lea Verou, and Dan Wilson.  Any errors are my fault, not theirs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you as well to all the technical reviewers of past editions, who are too many to name here, and all the people who have helped me understand various bits and bobs of CSS over the years, who are also far too many to name here.  If you ever explained some CSS to me, please write your name in the following blank: <span>_______________________</span>, you have my gratitude.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you to all the members of the CSS Working Group, past and present, who have shepherded an amazing language to astonishing heights…even as your work means we’ll face a real production dilemma for the next edition of this book, which is already pushing the limits of what printing technology can reasonably manage.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you to all the people who keep the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) up and running as well as up-to-date.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Special thanks to all the fine people at Open Web Docs for your work on MDN, and for asking me to serve as a member of your steering committee.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To my coauthor, Estelle, thank you for all your contributions, expertise, and pushes to do what was needed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To all the assorted friends, colleagues, coworkers, acquaintances, and passersby who have allowed space for my odd enthusiasms and strange demeanor, thank you for your understanding, patience, and kindness.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And as ever, my boundless gratitude to my family—my wife, Kat, and my children, Carolyn, Rebecca <em>z’’l</em>, and Joshua.  You are the home that shelters me, the suns in my sky, and the stars by which I steer.  Thank you for everything you have taught me.</p>&#13;

<p>I would like to acknowledge everyone who has worked to make CSS what it is today and all those who have helped improve diversity and inclusion in tech.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Many people work tirelessly with browser vendors and developers in writing the CSS specifications.  Without the members of the CSS Working Group—past, current, and future—we would have no specifications, no standards, and no cross-browser &#13;
<span class="keep-together">compatibility.</span> I am in awe of the thought process that goes into every CSS property and value added to, and omitted from, the specification. People like Tab Atkins, Elika Etimad, Dave Baron, Léonie Watson, and Greg Whitworth not only work on the specification, but also take their time to answer questions and explain nuances to the broader CSS public, notably me.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I also acknowledge all those who, whether they participate in the CSS Working Group or not, dive deep into CSS features and help translate the spec for the rest of us, including Sarah Drasner, Val Head, Sara Souidan, Chris Coyier, Jen Simmons, and Rachel Andrew. In addition, I thank the people who create tools that make all CSS developers’ lives easier, especially Alexis Deveria for creating and maintaining the <a href="https://caniuse.com">Can I Use tool</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I also appreciate all those who have contributed their time and effort to improve diversity and inclusion in all sectors of the developer community. Yes, CSS is awesome. But it’s important to work with great people in a great community.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When I attended my first tech conference in 2007, the lineup was 93% male and 100% white. The audience had slightly less gender diversity and only slightly more ethnic diversity. I had picked that conference because the lineup was more diverse than most: it actually had a woman on it. Looking around the room, I knew things needed to change, and I realized it was something I needed to do. What I didn’t realize then was how many unsung heroes I would meet over the next 10 years working for diversity and inclusion in all areas of the tech sector and life in general.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are too many people—who work tirelessly, quietly, and often with little or no recognition—to name them all, but I would like to highlight some. I cannot express how much of a positive impact people like Erica Stanley of Women Who Code Atlanta, Carina Zona of Callback Women, and Jenn Mei Wu of Oakland Maker Space have had. Groups like The Last Mile, Black Girls Code, Girls Incorporated, Sisters Code, and so many others inspired me to create a <a href="http://www.standardista.com/feeding-the-diversity-pipeline">Feeding the Diversity Pipeline list</a> to help ensure that the path to a career in web development is not only for those with privilege.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you to all of you. Thank you to everyone. Because of your efforts, more has been done than I ever could have imagined sitting in that conference 10 years ago.</p>&#13;
