<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes, the popular open source container management platform.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Helm" data-secondary="package manager" id="idm46126001395240"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="package managers" data-secondary="about" id="idm46126001394024"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="Helm" data-tertiary="package manager" id="idm46126001392872"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="package managers" data-secondary="Helm as" id="idm46125999442648"/></p>

<p>Package managers make platforms more accessible to those who use them. In order to use a platform like Kubernetes, you need to run software on it, and much of that software will be off-the-shelf or shared. Package managers like Helm enable you to install and start using the software quickly without needing to figure out how to make it run or run well on the platform, because it has already been packaged up in an easy-to-use manner.</p>

<p>If you have software you want to share with others, package managers make it easy to do. Platforms are more useful when there is a wide variety of software to run on them; open source projects and companies both like to make their software easy to install on the platforms it runs on, and Helm makes this possible for Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Package managers aren’t just for sharing and consuming others’ software, however. They are often an integral part of other systems, such as DevOps tooling, and they are used as a building block.</p>

<p>Virtually every modern platform has a package manager. Operating systems, programming languages, and cloud platforms all have package managers of some form.</p>

<p>In this book you will learn about Helm, which provides modern package management for Kubernetes, and the packages, called charts, that you can use with it. You will learn how to use Helm, how to create packages, and how to share those packages with other platforms.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="package managers" data-secondary="charts as packages" id="idm46125999436296"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="charts" data-secondary="as packages" data-secondary-sortas="packages" id="idm46125999435112"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="packages" data-secondary="charts as" id="idm46125999433688"/></p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm46125999432408">
<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>

<p>There are a few situations where you will find this book useful.</p>

<p>If you’re new to Kubernetes or want to learn how to install off-the-shelf applications, this book will help you learn how to do that with Helm. It is much easier and faster to install applications through Helm than it is to learn how to do so by hand with Kubernetes.</p>

<p>If you work for a company (or a project) that wants to distribute your applications to Kubernetes users in an easy-to-consume manner, this book will teach you how to do that with Helm. Being able to quickly install your application makes getting started easier, and Helm can help you with that.</p>

<p>This book is also for DevOps professionals who want to learn to use Kubernetes package management as part of their DevOps toolchains. Helm provides powerful and advanced features that can be used as building blocks for other automation. These have been used to deploy large and complex applications onto Kubernetes, and this book will teach you how to leverage those features.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why We Wrote This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm46125999427176">
<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>We, the authors, are maintainers of Helm, so we set out to write a book to help those who have questions about it. We didn’t just want to supply the  technical details that are often found in the documentation; we wanted to provide context and insight into what Helm does and why.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Navigating This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm46126001379512">
<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>

<p>The first three chapters introduce you to Helm and show you how to use the Helm client. This begins in <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#introducing_helm">Chapter 1</a> with an overview of where Helm sits within the cloud native ecosystem along with an overview of its architecture. Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.xhtml#Using_Helm">2</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.xhtml#beyond_the_basics_with_helm">3</a> address using the Helm client, beginning with installing Helm and progressing to advanced usage.</p>

<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch04.xhtml#building_a_chart">4</a> through <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch06.xhtml#advanced_charts">6</a> cover creating packages for Helm. This begins with how to create a package (<a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#building_a_chart">Chapter 4</a>), moves into learning the template syntax (<a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#developing_templates">Chapter 5</a>), and finishes with advanced features (<a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#advanced_charts">Chapter 6</a>). If you want to create packages for Helm, these chapters are for you.</p>

<p>Sharing packages, including their individual release versions, is covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#chart_repositories">Chapter 7</a>. Sharing is important if you are distributing software to others or sharing it between systems while using DevOps processes.</p>

<p>Helm can be extended, which is covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.xhtml#helm_plugins_and_starters">Chapter 8</a>. There are opportunities to customize Helm without needing to fork or contribute functionality to Helm.</p>

<p>Two appendixes are provided with reference material. <a data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#appendix_a_chart_api_versions">Appendix A</a> provides an overview of differences between current and legacy packages, while <a data-type="xref" href="app02.xhtml#appendix_b_chart_respoitory_api">Appendix B</a> covers the repository API used for sharing packages.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>This book has benefited from the attention of our official technical reviewers: Taylor Thomas, Jonathan Johnson, and Michael Hausenblas.</p>

<p>We would like to express our appreciation for everyone at O’Reilly who helped bring this project together. This is especially true of John Devins and Jeff Bleiel. The process of writing the book was delightful.</p>

<p>The Helm ecosystem was created by a legion of contributors from all around the globe. Individuals, nongovernmental organizations, and corporations have cooperated to build a technology that meets a broad array of needs. From building charts to contributing fixes to helping others learn Helm, individuals have devoted time and energy to improving the community and code for all. We deeply appreciate their work.</p>

<p>Most of all, we want to thank our wives and children for their patience and love throughout the process.</p>
