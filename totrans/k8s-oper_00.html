<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Kubernetes is a popular container orchestrator. It harnesses many computers together into one large computing resource and establishes a means of addressing that resource through the Kubernetes application programming interface (API).<a data-primary="Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343146392"/> Kubernetes is open source software with origins at Google, developed over the last five years by a large group of collaborators under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>An Operator extends Kubernetes to automate the management of the entire lifecycle of a particular application. Operators serve as a packaging mechanism for distributing applications on Kubernetes, and they monitor, maintain, recover, and upgrade the software they deploy.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’ve deployed applications on a Kubernetes cluster, you’ll be familiar with some of the challenges and aspirations that forged the Operator pattern. If you’ve maintained foundation services like databases and filesystems in their own ghetto outside your orchestrated clusters, and you yearn to bring them into the neighborhood, this guide to Kubernetes Operators is for you.</p>&#13;

<h1>What You Will Learn</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book explains what an Operator is and how Operators extend the Kubernetes API. It shows how to deploy and use existing Operators, and how to create and distribute Operators for your applications using the <a href="https://github.com/operator-framework">Red Hat Operator Framework</a>. We relate good practices for designing, building, and distributing Operators, and we explain the thinking that animates Operators with Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After describing Operators and their concepts in the first chapter, we’ll suggest ways to get access to a Kubernetes cluster where you can do the exercises in the rest of the book. With a cluster running, you’ll deploy an Operator and observe its behavior when its application fails, scales, or gets upgraded to a new version.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Later, we will explore the Operator SDK and show you how to use it to build an Operator to naturalize an example application as a first-class Kubernetes citizen.<a data-primary="Operator SDK" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343023864"/> With that practical foundation in place, we will discuss the SRE ideas from which Operators derive and the goals they share: reducing operations effort and cost, increasing service reliability, and spurring innovation by freeing teams from repetitive maintenance work.</p>&#13;

<h2>Operator Framework and SDK</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Operator pattern emerged at <a href="https://coreos.com">CoreOS</a> as a way to automate increasingly complex applications on Kubernetes clusters, including managing Kubernetes itself and the <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a> key-value store at its heart.<a data-primary="etcd key-value store" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343039048"/><a data-primary="CoreOS" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343038344"/> Work on Operators continued through an acquisition by Red Hat, leading to the 2018 release of the open source Operator Framework and SDK.<a data-primary="Red Hat Operator SDK" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343037384"/><a data-primary="Operator framework" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343036712"/> The examples in this book use the Red Hat Operator SDK and the distribution mechanisms that join it in the Operator Framework.</p>&#13;

<h2>Other Operator Tools</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A community has grown up around Operators, with more than a hundred Operators for an array of applications from many vendors and projects available in Red Hat’s distribution channels alone. Several other Operator construction tools exist. We won’t discuss them in detail, but after you read this book you’ll be able to compare any of them with the Operator SDK and Framework. <a data-primary="Java Operator SDK" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343033720"/><a data-primary="Kopf" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343033016"/><a data-primary="Kubebuilder" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45261343032344"/>Other open source tools available for building Operators include <a href="https://oreil.ly/JCL-S">Kopf</a> for Python, <a href="https://oreil.ly/8zdbj">Kubebuilder</a> from the Kubernetes project, and the <a href="https://oreil.ly/yXhVg">Java Operator SDK</a>.</p>&#13;
