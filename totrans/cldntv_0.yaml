- en: Thought leaders across different companies and industries have been restating
    Watts Humphrey’s statement, “Every business will become a software business.”
    He was spot on. Software is taking over the world and is challenging the status
    quo of existing companies. Netflix has revolutionized how we obtain and consume
    TV and movies, Uber has transformed the transportation industry, and Airbnb is
    challenging the hotel industry. A couple of years ago that would have been unthinkable,
    but software has allowed new companies to venture into all industries and establish
    new thinking and business models.

- en: The previously mentioned companies are often referred to as “born-in-the-cloud
    companies,” which means that at the basis of their offerings are services running
    in the cloud. Those services are built in a way that companies can quickly react
    to market and customer demands, release updates and fixes in a short period of
    time, use the latest technologies, and take advantage of the improved economics
    provided by the cloud. Services built in a cloud native way have also allowed
    companies to rethink their business models and move to new ones, such as subscription-based
    models. Such services are often referred to as *cloud native applications*.

- en: The success and popularity of cloud native applications have led many enterprises
    to adopt cloud native architectures, even bringing many of the concepts to on-premises
    applications.

- en: At the heart of cloud native applications are *containers*, *functions*, and
    *data*. There are many books out there focusing on each of these specific technologies.
    Cloud native applications use all of these technologies and take advantage of
    and exploit all of the benefits of the cloud. We, the authors, have seen many
    customers struggle to piece all of those technologies together to design and develop
    cloud native applications, so we decided to write a book with the goal to provide
    the foundational knowledge that enables developers and architects alike to get
    started with designing cloud native applications.

- en: This book starts by laying down the foundation for the reader to understand
    the basic principles of distributed computing and how they relate to cloud native
    applications, as well as providing a closer look at containers and functions.
    Further, it covers service communication patterns, resiliency, and data patterns
    as well as providing guidance on when to use what. The book concludes by explaining
    the DevOps approach, portability considerations, and a collection of best practices
    that we have seen to be useful in successful cloud native applications.

- en: The book is not a step-by-step implementation guide for building cloud native
    applications for a specific set of requirements. After reading this book, you
    should have the understanding and knowledge to help design, build, and operate
    successful cloud native applications. Tutorials are great for working through
    very specific needs, but a fundamental understanding of building cloud native
    applications provides teams with the necessary skills to ship successful cloud
    native applications.
