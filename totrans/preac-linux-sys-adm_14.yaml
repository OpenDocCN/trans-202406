    your career. And if you’re certified, many certifications require some continuing
    education units (CEUs) per year that you must document and submit to the certifying
    authority. But continuing your education involves more than just gathering certifications
    and collecting CEUs yearly to maintain those certifications. Continuing your education
    means expanding your horizons, learning something new, and enhancing your skills
    as a technologist.

    produces, conducts, or hosts. I’m not referring to those annual refresher courses
    we must take to satisfy regulatory requirements. I’m referring to technical résumé-building
    classes that enhance your skills and knowledge. Internal training is either training
    that your company develops and delivers to employees or training that your company
    purchases and delivers on-premises. The delivery method depends on many factors,
    such as cost, instructor availability, time, and other logistical considerations.

- en: There is a downside to internal training, and it’s that the training occurs
    on-site. Yes, one of the advantages is also a disadvantage. When you train at
    your local facility, you risk having users, colleagues, or your manager interrupt
    your training to have you fix something that will “only take a minute.” These
    disruptions and interruptions, while possibly necessary, are detrimental to your
    learning. You miss valuable information, demonstrations, and lessons that are
    often difficult to go back and pick up on your own. Personally, every on-premises
    class I’ve taken has been interrupted by support calls. My managers always reminded
    me that “training is a privilege” and “the job comes first” when I requested dedicated
    time for training. Be prepared for your training to be interrupted or even discontinued
    due to the requirements of your job.

- en: In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was an industry-wide effort to get
    technical people certified. However, many certification classes focused so much
    on teaching test answers that the learning was thin, and experienced technical
    folks considered certifications to have little value. Certification gets a bad
    rap because of this trend. Professionals offended by the number of freshly certified
    IT people then began to seek “higher level” certifications such as Cisco’s CCNA,
    CCNE, and others because they were perceived as legitimate, while those from other
    vendors weren’t.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fast-forward to present day, and IT certifications are still a thing; certain
    certifications are still considered more legitimate and worthy than others. A
    good example is the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).
    This high-level certification has become so popular that an entire industry is
    now built around it. There are courses, study guides, boot camps, exam pass guarantees,
    cram sessions, hundreds of books, and more. When the industry becomes saturated
    with this certification, which was once very highly regarded, a new contender
    for everyone’s attention and money will rise up to replace it as the next big
    certification to earn.

    can still fail expensive certification exams. Do yourself a favor and prepare
    for the exam regardless of your level of expertise, experience, or job duties.
    Exams have a way of wording questions that can confuse or mislead the most experienced
    professionals. Don’t take the exam lightly, and don’t assume that you already
    know everything. Certification exams are serious business.

- en: Hundreds of books and other preparation materials are available for free or
    at a reasonable cost. You should take practice exams to learn how exam question
    writers phrase scenarios. Most exams are scenario-based. This means that you have
    to be able to *apply* your knowledge and not just remember facts. Remembering
    facts will help you with some questions, but you must read a scenario and decide
    based on your options. And the scenarios and questions are rarely straightforward.
    My best advice is to use at least two different study sources by different authors
    to have a range of perspectives and practice questions written by multiple authors.

    can sign in, calm down, use the restroom, and get into a test-taking mindset.
    The test proctor will escort you into the exam room, which is sometimes private
    but can be a room where multiple people are also taking exams. Before entering
    the exam room, the proctor will have you empty your pockets, remove your jacket,
    and surrender your cell phone. Your belongings will be placed in a locker while
    you take the exam. If you’re allowed to have any scratch paper and a pen, those
    will be provided to you at exam time. Proctors will advise you of exam rules and
    conduct during the exam. Once you’re finished with the exam, instructions will
    appear on the screen to tell you what to do next, typically returning to the main
    desk to receive your exam results. Most exams are scored when you finish them,
    so you’ll know whether you passed before leaving the exam facility. The proctor
    may provide you with your exam results. The proctor will also return your belongings
    to you from your locker.

    while the exam questions and subject matter are fresh in your mind. Your exam
    results will often highlight your strongest and weakest topics so that you can
    focus on those before you retake the exam. Do retake the exam until you pass.
    Once you’re certified, no one will care how many times you have to take the exam.

    At one time, in IT shops, training was almost nonexistent. Companies didn’t want

    and set up multiple systems in my garage, onto which I installed various operating
    systems and experimented. I installed operating systems, applications, and automation
    software. At one time, I had a Hyper-V infrastructure, a vSphere infrastructure,
    dozens of virtual machines comprising multiple Linux distributions, multiple Microsoft
    desktop and server systems, and even a few one-offs such as FreeBSD, FreeDOS,
    and a few others that I can’t recall. I would solve hardware, software, networking,
    printing, and application problems independently. Expanding my knowledge beyond
    my day job has kept me gainfully employed in full-time corporate jobs and a healthy
    freelance career for over 20 years. Part of my independent-study result is what

    Solaris system in one of our computer labs had experienced a failure. Due to layoffs
    and attrition, no one knew how to fix the system because the version of Solaris
    was so old. Unfortunately, the system owners also didn’t know how to fix it, but
    it had to be fixed because real dependencies were built around it. A company-wide
    email was issued to find someone who knew how to fix this computer dinosaur. I
    saw the email but ignored it until one of my colleagues, who knew of my independent
    study and history of solving weird problems, spoke up and volunteered me for the
    task. I successfully got the system working again that afternoon. The customer
    was grateful, and I received a few accolades and a gift card for a nice dinner
    for my efforts.

    You can sign up for free or inexpensive virtual infrastructure and explore cloud
    solutions, N-tier database setups, peer-to-peer networking, software development,
    and other technologies and solutions that would cost thousands of dollars to build
    on your own. Through independent discovery and exploration, you can develop skills
    with technologies you ordinarily wouldn’t have access to. I encourage you to search
    online to find independent-study opportunities.

    don’t have degrees are about as common as those who do. I’ve had managers who
    never went to a day of college. I’ve also worked with some people who earned master’s
    and PhD degrees in fields other than IT. Many of them, like myself, came to IT
    from other industries as career changers. There are multiple reasons for IT ranks
    being filled with people with degrees as diverse as psychology, English, and physics.
    Traditional colleges and universities didn’t support IT training until somewhat
    recently. Sure, a few colleges and universities offered management information
    systems (MIS) and computer information systems (CIS) degrees before that time.
    Still, these programs were light on content and not well-respected in the industry
    in the early days. These days, full degree programs cover game development, data
    science, networking, security, and cloud technologies.

    universities offer remote, online, and self-paced study, which is optimal for
    working professionals who want to further their education and skills without the
    traditional residence requirements. But not all degree programs are created equal.
    Some programs are not well-received in the industry, and you should research before
    spending thousands of dollars on a degree that many employers will dismiss as

    exploring is on the approved list. If it isn’t, keep looking until you find one
