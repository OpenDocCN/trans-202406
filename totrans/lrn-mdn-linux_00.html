<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>A warm welcome to <em>Learning Modern Linux</em>! I’m glad that we will walk this
journey together for a bit. This book is for you if you’ve already been using Linux
and are looking for a structured, hands-on approach to dive in deeper,
or if you already have experience and want to get some
tips and tricks to improve your flow when working with Linux—for example, in
a professional setup, such as development or operations.</p>

<p>We’ll focus on using Linux for your everyday needs, from development to
office-related tasks, rather than on the system administration side of things.
Also, we’ll focus on the command line, not visual UIs.
So, while 2022 might be the year of Linux on the desktop after all, we’ll use the terminal as the main way to interact with Linux. This has the
additional advantage that you can equally apply your knowledge in many different
setups, from a Raspberry Pi to the virtual machine of your cloud provider of
choice.</p>

<p>Before we start, I’d like to provide some context by sharing my own journey:
my first hands-on experience with an operating system was not with Linux. The
first operating system I used was AmigaOS (in the late 80s), and after that, in technical
high school, I mainly used Microsoft DOS and the then-new Microsoft Windows,
specifically around the event system and user interface–related development.
Then, in the mid- to late 1990s, during my studies at university, I mainly
used Unix-based Solaris and Silicon Graphics machines in the university labs. I really only got into Linux in
the mid-2000s in the context of big data and then when I started working with containers,
first in 2015 in the context of Apache Mesos (working at Mesosphere), and then
with Kubernetes (initially at Red Hat on the OpenShift team and then at AWS on
the container service team). That’s where I realized that one needs to master Linux to be effective in this space. Linux is different. Its background, worldwide community of users, and versatility and flexibility make it unique.</p>

<p>Linux is an interesting, ever-growing ecosystem of open source individuals and
vendors. It runs on pretty much anything under the sun, from the $50
Raspberry Pi to the virtual machines of your favorite cloud provider to a Mars vehicle.
After 30 years in the making, Linux will likely stick around
for some time, so now is a good time to get into Linux a bit deeper.</p>

<p>Let’s first set some ground rules and expectations. In the preface, I’ll
share how you can get the most out of this book as well as some administrative things,
like where and how you can try out the topics we’ll work through together.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="About You"><div class="sect1" id="idm45805455129280">
<h1>About You</h1>

<p>This book is for those who want or need to use Linux in a professional
setup, such as software developers, software architects, QA testing engineers,
DevOps and SRE roles, and similar roles. I’ll assume that if you’re a hobbyist encountering
Linux when pursuing an activity such as 3D printing or home improvement, you have very little to no knowledge about operating systems in general or
Linux/UNIX in particular. You will get the most out of the book if you work through
it from beginning to end, as the chapters tend to build on one another; however,
you can also use it as a reference if you’re already familiar with Linux.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="How to Use the Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45805455156448">
<h1>How to Use the Book</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="environments for hands-on experience" id="idm45805455109632"/>The focus of this book is enabling you to use Linux, not administer it. There are
plenty of great books about Linux administration out there.</p>

<p>By the end of this book, you will understand what Linux is (<a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#intro-to-linux">Chapter 1</a>)
and what its critical components are (Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.xhtml#kernel">2</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.xhtml#shells-scripting">3</a>). You’ll be able to enumerate and use essential access control mechanisms (<a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#access-control">Chapter 4</a>).
You’ll also understand the role of filesystems (<a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#files">Chapter 5</a>) as a fundamental
building block in Linux as well as know what apps (<a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#running-apps">Chapter 6</a>) are.</p>

<p>Then, you’ll get some hands-on experience with the Linux networking
stack and tooling (<a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#networking">Chapter 7</a>). Further, you’ll
learn about modern operating system observability (<a data-type="xref" href="ch08.xhtml#observability">Chapter 8</a>) and how
to apply it to manage your workloads.</p>

<p>You’ll understand how to run Linux applications in modern ways by using
containers as well as immutable distros such as Bottlerocket and also how to
securely communicate (download files, etc.) and share data using Secure Shell (SSH) and
advanced tooling like peer-to-peer and cloud sync mechanisms (<a data-type="xref" href="ch09.xhtml#advanced">Chapter 9</a>).</p>

<p class="pagebreak-after">Following are suggestions for ways you can try things out and follow along (and I
strongly recommend you do; learning Linux is like learning a language—you want to practice
a lot):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Get a Linux desktop or laptop. For example, I have a very
nice machine called StarBook from <a href="https://oreil.ly/1MbY2">Star Labs</a>.
Alternatively, you could use a desktop or laptop that no longer runs a recent
Windows version and install Linux on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to experiment on a different (host) operating system—say, your
MacBook or iMac—you could use a virtual machine (VM). For example, on macOS
you could use the excellent <a href="https://oreil.ly/bqVYG">Linux-on-Mac</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your cloud provider of choice to spin up a Linux-based VM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you’re into tinkering and want to try out a non-Intel processor
architecture such as ARM, you could buy a single-board computer such as the
wonderful <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, you should have an environment at hand and practice a lot. Don’t just read: try out commands and experiment. Try to
“break” things, for example, by providing nonsensical or deliberately strange
inputs. Before you execute the command, form a hypothesis about the outcome.</p>

<p>Another tip: always ask <em>why</em>. When you see a command or a certain output, try
to figure out where it came from and what the underlying component responsible
for 
<span class="keep-together">it is.</span></p>

<section data-type="sect1" class="pagebreak-before less_space" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="idm45805454924608">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>First off, I’d like to thank the fabulous reviewers of the book: Chris Negus,
John Bonesio, and Pawel Krupa. Without their feedback, this book wouldn’t be
half as good or useful.</p>

<p>I want to thank my parents, who enabled my education and laid the foundations
for who I am and what I do today. Big kudos to my big sister, Monika,
who was my inspiration to get into tech in the first place.</p>

<p>I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my very awesome and supportive family:
my kids, Saphira, Ranya, and Iannis; my wicked smart and fun wife, Anneliese; our bestest of all dogs, Snoopy; and our newest family member, Charlie
the 
<span class="keep-together">tomcat.</span></p>

<p>In the context of my Unix and Linux journey, there are way too many people who
influenced my thinking and from whom I learned a lot. I had the
pleasure and privilege of working with or interacting with many of them, including but not limited to Jérôme Petazzoni, Jessie Frazelle,
Brendan Gregg, Justin Garrison, Michael Kerrisk, and Douglas McIlroy.</p>

<p>Last, but most certainly not least, I’d like to thank the O’Reilly team,
especially my development editor, Jeff Bleiel, for shepherding me through
the process of writing this book.</p>
