- en: This book is for programmers who want to create web applications (traditional
    websites; single-page applications with React, Angular, or Vue; REST APIs; or
    anything in between) using JavaScript, Node, and Express. One of the exciting
    aspects of Node development is that it has attracted a whole new audience of programmers.
    The accessibility and flexibility of JavaScript have attracted self-taught programmers
    from all over the world. At no time in the history of computer science has programming
    been so accessible. The number and quality of online resources for learning to
    program (and getting help when you get stuck) is truly astonishing and inspiring.
    So to those new (possibly self-taught) programmers, I welcome you.

- en: Then, of course, there are the programmers like me, who have been around for
    a while. Like many programmers of my era, I started off with assembler and BASIC
    and went through Pascal, C++, Perl, Java, PHP, Ruby, C, C#, and JavaScript. At
    university, I was exposed to more niche languages such as ML, LISP, and PROLOG.
    Many of these languages are near and dear to my heart, but in none of these languages
    do I see so much promise as I do in JavaScript. So I am also writing this book
    for programmers like myself, who have a lot of experience and perhaps a more philosophical
    outlook on specific technologies.

- en: No experience with Node is necessary, but you should have some experience with
    JavaScript. If you’re new to programming, I recommend [Codecademy](http://bit.ly/2KfDqkQ).
    If you’re an intermediate or experienced programmer, I recommend my own book,
    *[Learning JavaScript, 3rd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035534.do)*
    (O’Reilly). The examples in this book can be used with any system that Node works
    on (which covers Windows, macOS, and Linux, among others). The examples are geared
    toward command-line (terminal) users, so you should have some familiarity with
    your system’s terminal.

    the future of the internet and want to be part of it. Excited about learning new
    things, new techniques, and new ways of looking at web development. If, dear reader,
    you are not excited, I hope you will be by the time you reach the end of this
    book….

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was a joy to write the first edition of this book, and I am to this day pleased
    with the practical advice I was able to put into it and the warm response of my
    readers. The first edition was published just as Express 4.0 was released from
    beta, and while Express is still on version 4.x, the middleware and tools that
    go along with Express have undergone *massive* changes. Furthermore, JavaScript
    itself has evolved, and even the way web applications are designed has undergone
    a tectonic shift (away from pure server-side rendering and toward single-page
    applications [SPAs]). While many of the principles in the first edition are still
    useful and valid, the specific techniques and tools are almost completely different.
    A new edition is overdue. Because of the ascendancy of SPAs, the focus of this
    second edition has also shifted to place more emphasis on Express as a server
    for APIs and static assets, and it includes an SPA example.

    will introduce you to Node and Express and some of the tools you’ll be using throughout
    the book. In [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch_saving_time_with_express) and [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch_tidying_up),
    you start using Express and build the skeleton of a sample website that will be
    used as a running example throughout the rest of the book.'

    covers some of Node’s more important constructs and how they are extended and
    used by Express. [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch_templating) covers templating (using
    Handlebars), which lays the foundation of building useful websites with Express.
    [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch_form_handling) and [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch_cookies_and_sessions)
    cover cookies, sessions, and form handlers, rounding out the things you need to
    know to build basic functional websites with Express.'

    to send email from the server and discusses security and layout issues inherent
    to email.'

    example will be used throughout the book: the Meadowlark Travel website. I wrote
    the first edition just after getting back from a trip to Lisbon, and I had travel
    on my mind, so the example website I chose is for a fictional travel company in
    my home state of Oregon (the Western Meadowlark is the state songbird of Oregon).
    Meadowlark Travel allows travelers to connect to local “amateur tour guides,”
    and it partners with companies offering bike and scooter rentals and local tours,
    with a focus on ecotourism.'

    not be complete; it merely serves as a fictional example of a real-world website
    to provide depth and context to the examples. Presumably, you are working on your
    own website, and you can use the Meadowlark Travel example as a template for it.
