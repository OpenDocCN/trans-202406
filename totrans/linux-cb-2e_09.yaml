- en: GParted, the GNOME Partition Manager, is one of my favorite tools on Linux.
    GParted is a nice graphical front-end to the *parted* partition manager command
    and all of the filesystem management commands. You can create, delete, move, copy,
    and resize partitions and filesystems, and create new partition tables with just
    a few clicks. Other features are data rescue and managing labels and UUIDs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Labels on partitions and filesystems are useful for identifying partitions and
    filesystems in a friendly way, and to give filesystems short, easy names. Without
    a label, a filesystem is identified by its long UUID. For example, when you plug
    in a USB stick without filesystem labels, it appears as something like */media/username/1d742b2d-a621-4454-b4d3-469216a6f01e*.
    Give it a nice short label like *mystuff*, and then it mounts as */media/username/mystuff*.

    the filesystems that are required for your running system. In this case, use a
    bootable SystemRescue CD/USB ([Chapter 19](Images/ch19.html#cha-rescue-recovery)).
    If you are running a multiboot system with more than one Linux distribution installed,
    boot to a different Linux and run GParted from there (see [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#cha-install-linux)).

    for modern large hard disks and is easier to manage and more resilient than the
    old MS-DOS partition table. See the introduction to [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#cha-partitioning-parted)
