<h1><span class="label">Chapter 8. </span>Wrapping Up</h1>


<p>Thanks for joining this whirlwind tour on anything that’s relevant to the Certified Kubernetes Administrator certification. I condensed the most relevant information in this book for you to succeed. Your journey does not end here. In fact, it’s only the beginning as there’s so much more learn in the realm of Kubernetes. I would encourage you to dive deeper into the topics discussed in this book and branch out even further into the Kubernetes tooling ecosystem.</p>

<p>Before we conclude, let me summarize the most important points for acing the exam. The key for scoring as many points as possible is to practice, practice, practice. Run through the sample exercises in this book, tap into free and commercial practice exams, and even come up with your own practice scenarios to learn the ins and outs of Kubernetes and <code>kubectl</code>. To solidify your exposure to Kubernetes, read the Kubernetes documentation from start to end at least once. In the course of this book, we’ve seen that the exam is about more than just testing your knowledge of <code>kubectl</code>. You’ll also need to be comfortable with other tools like vim, bash, and YAML.</p>

<p>I wish you all the best for acquiring the CKA certification. With this book, I hope I can give you the relevant information and learning strategies to succeed.</p>
