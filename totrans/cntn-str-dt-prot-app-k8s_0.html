      <h1>Preface</h1>
      <p>This report is for DevOps engineers, platform architects, site reliability teams, and application owners with a vested interest in managing storage for Kubernetes applications and services. The following pages provide a discussion of the challenges of data storage for distributed applications at scale, how to solve them, and considerations for moving to Kubernetes. </p>
      <p>The first chapter outlines the reasons why adopting Kubernetes in an enterprise production environment is complex, focusing on how traditional storage fails to meet the needs of modern cloud native applications. A discussion of Kubernetes storage primitives follows, including the Container Storage Interface and a brief explanation of how software-defined storage can support Kubernetes workloads. Following this foundation, the remaining chapters enumerate enterprise data needs and strategies for meeting them with Kubernetes storage. Topics include topology strategies for scale and efficiency, security, and the challenges of data protection.</p>
      <p>Read on to learn how Kubernetes changes the storage and data management landscape, the essential elements of a Kubernetes-native storage solution, and best practices for running stateful enterprise applications on Kubernetes.</p>
