<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>With the mainstream adoption of microservices and containers in recent years, the way we design, develop, and run software has changed radically. Today’s applications are optimized for availability, scalability, and speed-to-market. Driven by these new requirements, today’s modern applications require a different set of patterns and practices. This book aims to help developers discover and learn about the most common patterns for creating cloud native applications with Kubernetes. First, let’s take a brief look at the two primary ingredients of this book: Kubernetes and design patterns.</p>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

<h1>Kubernetes</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Kubernetes</em> is<a data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="history and origin of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902106253856"/><a data-primary="container orchestration platforms" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902114891712"/> a container orchestration platform. The origin of Kubernetes lies somewhere in the Google data centers where Google’s internal container orchestration platform, <a href="https://oreil.ly/x12HH">Borg</a>, was born. Google used Borg for many years to run its applications. In 2014, Google decided to transfer its experience with Borg into a new open source project called “Kubernetes” (Greek for “helmsman” or “pilot”). In 2015, it became the first project donated to the newly founded<a data-primary="Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902117583536"/><a data-primary="CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902112891328"/> Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From the start, Kubernetes gained a whole community of users, and the number of contributors grew incredibly fast. Today, Kubernetes is considered one of the most popular projects on GitHub. It is fair to claim that Kubernetes is the most commonly used and feature-rich container orchestration platform. Kubernetes also forms the foundation of other platforms built on top of it. The most prominent of those<a data-primary="Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902117570800"/><a data-primary="PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902117448080"/> Platform-as-a-Service systems is<a data-primary="Red Hat OpenShift" data-secondary="benefits of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902113013936"/> Red Hat OpenShift, which provides various additional capabilities to Kubernetes. These are only some reasons we chose Kubernetes as the reference platform for the cloud native patterns in this book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book assumes you have some basic knowledge of Kubernetes.&#13;
In <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#kubernetes-core-concepts">Chapter 1</a>, we recapitulate the core Kubernetes concepts and lay the foundation for the following patterns.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Design Patterns" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="preface-design-patterns">&#13;
<h1>Design Patterns</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The<a data-primary="design patterns" data-type="indexterm" id="despat00"/> concept of <em>design patterns</em> dates back to the 1970s and is from the field of architecture. Christopher Alexander, an architect and system theorist, and his team published the groundbreaking <a href="https://oreil.ly/TKzwz"><em>A Pattern Language</em></a> (Oxford University Press) in 1977, which describes architectural patterns for creating towns, buildings, and other construction projects. Sometime later, this idea was adopted by the newly formed software industry. The most famous book in this area is <a href="https://oreil.ly/k5toF"><em>Design Patterns—Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em></a> by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides—the Gang of Four (Addison-Wesley). When we talk about the famous Singleton, Factories, or Delegation patterns, it’s because of this defining work. Many other great pattern books have been written since then for various fields with different levels of granularity, like <em><a href="https://oreil.ly/5aRjR">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a></em> by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf (Addison-Wesley) or <a href="https://oreil.ly/yOdWA"><em>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</em></a> by Martin Fowler (Addison-Wesley).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In short, a <em>pattern</em> describes a <em>repeatable solution to a problem</em>.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="preface01.html#idm45902099359264" id="idm45902099359264-marker">1</a></sup> This definition works for the patterns we describe in this book, except that we probably don’t have as much variability in our solutions. A pattern is different from a recipe because instead of giving step-by-step instructions to solve a problem, it provides a blueprint for solving a whole class of similar problems. For example, the Alexandrian pattern <em>Beer Hall</em> describes how public drinking halls should be constructed where “strangers and friends are drinking companions” and not “anchors of the lonely.” All halls built after this pattern look different but share common characteristics, such as open alcoves for groups of four to eight and a place where a hundred people can meet to enjoy beverages, music, and other activities.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>However, a pattern does more than provide a solution. It is also about forming a language. The patterns in this book form a dense, noun-centric language in which each pattern carries a unique <em>name</em>. When this language is established, these names automatically evoke similar mental representations when people speak about these patterns. For example, when we talk about a table, anyone speaking English assumes we are talking about a piece of wood with four legs and a top on which you can put things. The same thing happens in software engineering when discussing a “factory.” In an object-oriented programming language context, we immediately associate with a “factory” an object that produces other objects. Because we immediately know the solution behind the pattern, we can move on to tackle yet-unsolved problems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are also other characteristics of a pattern language. For example, patterns are interconnected and can overlap so that they cover most of the problem space. Also, as already laid out in the original <em>A Pattern Language</em>, patterns have a different level of granularity and scope. More general patterns cover an extensive problem space and provide rough guidance on how to solve the problem. Granular patterns have a very concrete solution proposal but are less widely applicable. This book contains all sorts of patterns, and many patterns reference other patterns or may even include other patterns as part of the solution.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another feature of patterns is that they follow a rigid format. However, each author defines a different form; unfortunately, there is no common standard for how patterns should be laid out. Martin Fowler gives an excellent overview of the formats used for pattern languages at <a href="https://oreil.ly/6IA6k">“Writing Software Patterns”</a>.<a data-primary="" data-startref="despat00" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902098566144"/></p>&#13;

<h1>How This Book Is Structured</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We chose a simple pattern format for this book. We do not follow any particular pattern description language. For each pattern, we use the following structure:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Name</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Each pattern carries a name, which is also the chapter’s title. The name is the center of the pattern’s language.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Problem</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This section gives the broader context and describes the pattern space in detail.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Solution</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This section shows how the pattern solves the problem in a Kubernetes-specific way. This section also contains cross-references to other patterns that are either related or part of the given pattern.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Discussion</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This section includes a discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of the solution for the given context.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>More Information</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This final section contains additional information sources related to the pattern.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We organized the patterns in this book as follows:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part01.html#part_foundational">Part I, “Foundational Patterns”</a>, covers the core concepts of Kubernetes. These are the underlying principles and practices for building container-based cloud native applications.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who This Book Is For" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45902098809072">&#13;
<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is for <em>developers</em> who want to design and develop cloud native applications and use Kubernetes as the platform. It is most suitable for readers who have some basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts and want to take it to the next level. However, you don’t need to know the low-level details of Kubernetes to understand the use cases and patterns. Architects, consultants, and other technical personnel will also benefit from the repeatable patterns described here.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The book is based on use cases and lessons learned from real-world projects. It is an accumulation of best practices and patterns after years of working in this space. We want to help you understand the Kubernetes-first mindset and create better cloud native applications—not reinvent the wheel. It is written in a relaxed style and is similar to a series of essays that can be read independently.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s briefly look at what this book is <em>not</em>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>This book is not an introduction to Kubernetes, nor is it a reference manual. We touch on many Kubernetes features and explain them in some detail, but we are focusing on the concepts behind those features. <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.html#kubernetes-core-concepts">Chapter 1, “Introduction”</a>, offers a brief refresher on Kubernetes basics. If you are looking for a comprehensive book on Kubernetes, we highly recommend <em>Kubernetes in Action</em> by Marko Lukša (Manning Publications).</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>This book is not a step-by-step guide on how to set up a Kubernetes cluster itself. Every example assumes you have Kubernetes up and running. You have several options for trying out the examples. If you are interested in learning how to set up a Kubernetes cluster, we recommend <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781098110192"><em>Kubernetes: Up and Running</em></a> by Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, and Lachlan Evenson (O’Reilly).</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>This book is not about operating and governing a Kubernetes cluster for other teams. We deliberately skipped administrative and operational aspects of Kubernetes and took a developer-first view into Kubernetes. This book can help operations teams understand how a developer uses Kubernetes, but it is not sufficient for administering and automating a Kubernetes cluster. If you are interested in learning how to operate a Kubernetes cluster, we recommend <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-best-practices/9781492056461/"><em>Kubernetes Best Practices</em></a> by Brendan Burns, Eddie Villalba, Dave Strebel, and Lachlan Evenson (O’Reilly).</p>&#13;

<h1>What You Will Learn</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There’s a lot to discover in this book. Some patterns may read like excerpts from a Kubernetes manual at first glance, but upon closer look, you’ll see the patterns are presented from a conceptual angle not found in other books on the topic. Other patterns are explained with detailed steps to solve a concrete problem, as in <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="part04.html#part_configuration">Part IV, “Configuration Patterns”</a>. In some chapters, we explain Kubernetes features that don’t fit nicely into a pattern definition. Don’t get hung up on whether it is a pattern or a feature. In all chapters, we look at the forces involved from the first principles and focus on the use cases, lessons learned, and best practices. That is the valuable part.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Regardless of the pattern granularity, you will learn everything Kubernetes offers for each particular pattern, with plenty of examples to illustrate the concepts. All these examples have been tested, and we tell you how to get the complete source code in <a data-type="xref" href="#preface-code-examples">“Using Code Examples”</a>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="What’s New in the Second Edition" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45902099557008">&#13;
<h1>What’s New in the Second Edition</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Kubernetes ecosystem has continued to grow since the first edition came out four years ago. As a result, there have been many Kubernetes releases, and more tools and patterns for using Kubernetes have become de facto standards.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Fortunately, most of the patterns described in our book have stood the test of time and remain valid. Therefore, we have updated these patterns, added new features up to Kubernetes 1.26, and removed obsolete and deprecated parts.&#13;
For the most part, only minor changes were necessary, except for <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch29.html#ElasticScale">Chapter 29, “Elastic Scale”</a>, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch30.html#ImageBuilder">Chapter 30, “Image Builder”</a>, which underwent significant changes due to new developments in these areas.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Additionally, we have included five new patterns and introduced a new category, <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part05.html#part_security">Part V, “Security Patterns”</a>, which addresses a gap in the first edition and provides important security-related patterns for developers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Our GitHub <a href="https://oreil.ly/kXGjC">examples</a> have been updated and extended. And, lastly, we added 50% more content for our readers to enjoy.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Conventions Used in This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45902100760160">&#13;
<h1>Conventions Used in This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The following typographical conventions are used in this book:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt><em>Italic</em></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and file extensions.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt><code>Constant width</code></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Used for program listings, as well as within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or function names, databases, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As mentioned, patterns form a simple, interconnected language. To emphasize this web of patterns, each pattern is capitalized and set in italics, (e.g., <em>Sidecar</em>). When a pattern name is also a Kubernetes core concept (such as <em>Init Container</em> or <em>Controller</em>), we use this specific formatting only when we directly reference the pattern itself. Where it makes sense, we also interlink pattern chapters for ease of navigation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We also use the following conventions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Everything you can type in a shell or editor is rendered in <code>constant width font</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Kubernetes resource names are always rendered in uppercase (e.g., Pod). If the resource is a combined name like ConfigMap, we keep it like this in favor of the more natural “config map” for clarity and to make it clear that it refers to a Kubernetes concept.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Sometimes, a Kubernetes resource name is identical to a common concept like “service” or “node.” In these cases, we use the resource name format only when referring to the resource itself.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>&#13;
<p>This element signifies a tip or suggestion.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>This element signifies a general note.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Using Code Examples" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="preface-code-examples">&#13;
<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Every pattern<a data-primary="code examples, obtaining and using" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45902099726656"/> is backed with fully executable examples, which you can find on the accompanying <a href="https://k8spatterns.io">web page</a>. You can find the link to each pattern’s example in each chapter’s “More Information” section.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The “More Information” section also contains links to further information related to the pattern. We keep these lists updated in the example repository.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The source code for all examples in this book is available on <a href="https://oreil.ly/bmj-Y">GitHub</a>. The repository and the website also have pointers and instructions on how to get a Kubernetes cluster to try out the examples. Please look at the provided resource files when you go through the examples. They contain many valuable comments that will further your understanding of the example code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Many examples use a REST service called <em>random-generator</em> that returns random numbers when called. It is uniquely crafted to play well with the examples in this book. Its source can be found on <a href="https://oreil.ly/WuYSu">GitHub</a> as well, and its container image <code>k8spatterns/random-generator</code> is hosted on <a href="https://oreil.ly/N36MB">Docker Hub</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We use a JSON path notation to describe resource fields (e.g., <code>.spec.replicas</code> points to the <code>replicas</code> field of the resource’s <code>spec</code> section).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you find an issue in the example code or documentation or have a question, don’t hesitate to open a ticket at the <a href="https://oreil.ly/hCnmn">GitHub issue tracker</a>. We monitor these GitHub issues and are happy to answer any questions.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Bilgin is forever grateful to his wonderful wife, Ayshe, for her endless support and patience as he worked on yet another book. He is also thankful for his adorable daughters, Selin and Esin, who always know how to bring a smile to his face. You mean the world to him. Finally, Bilgin would like to thank his fantastic coauthor, Roland, for making this project a reality.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Roland is deeply grateful for his wife Tanja’s unwavering support and forbearance throughout the writing process, and he also thanks his son Jakob for his encouragement. Furthermore, Roland wishes to extend special recognition to Bilgin for his exceptional insights and writing, without which the book would not have come to fruition.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Creating two editions of this book was a long multiyear journey, and we want to thank our reviewers who kept us on the right track.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For the first edition, special kudos to Paolo Antinori and Andrea Tarocchi for helping us through the journey. Big thanks to Marko Lukša, Brandon Philips, Michael Hüttermann, Brian Gracely, Andrew Block, Jiri Kremser, Tobias Schneck, and Rick Wagner, who supported us with their expertise and advice. Last but not least, big thanks to our editors Virginia Wilson, John Devins, Katherine Tozer, Christina Edwards, and all the awesome folks at O’Reilly for helping us push this book over the finish line.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Completing the second edition was no easy feat, and we are grateful to all who supported us in finishing it. We extend our thanks to our technical reviewers, Ali Ok, Dávid Šimanský, Zbyněk Roubalík, Erkan Yanar, Christoph Stäbler, Andrew Block, and Adam Kaplan, as well as to our development editor, Rita Fernando, for her patience and encouragement throughout the whole process. Many kudos go out to the O’Reilly production team, especially Beth Kelly, Kim Sandoval, and Judith McConville, for their meticulous attention in finalizing the book.</p>&#13;
