<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>JavaScript has come a long way since its introduction in late 1995. In the early days, the core APIs built into web browsers were limited. More advanced functionality &#13;
<span class="keep-together">typically</span> required third-party JavaScript libraries, or in some cases even browser &#13;
<span class="keep-together">plug-ins.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A web API is a series of global objects and functions exposed by the browser. Your JavaScript code can use these to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), perform network communication, integrate with native device features, and much more.</p>&#13;
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="id682">&#13;
<h1>Polyfills</h1>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="polyfills" data-type="indexterm" id="id683"/>Older browsers can take advantage of some of these APIs by using polyfills. A <em>polyfill</em> is a JavaScript library that implements missing functionality. Polyfills are typically used for web API features that aren’t implemented in older browsers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>While beneficial, polyfills do have some drawbacks:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>They are loaded as third-party libraries, which add to your bundle size.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>They generally aren’t maintained by the browser teams, so there may be bugs or inconsistencies.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Some advanced functionality can’t be polyfilled in a performant way, or at all.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;

<h1>The Power of Modern Browsers</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Modern web APIs have two big advantages for the web platform:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>No more plug-ins</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>In the past, much of this functionality was only available to native applications or clunky browser plug-ins. (Remember ActiveX and Flash?)</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Fewer third-party dependencies</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Modern browsers provide considerable functionality that used to require third-party JavaScript libraries. Popular libraries such as jQuery, Lodash, and Moment are usually not needed anymore.</p>&#13;

<h1>Drawbacks of Third-Party Libraries</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="libraries, third-party" data-type="indexterm" id="id684"/><a data-primary="third-party libraries" data-type="indexterm" id="id685"/>Third-party libraries can be helpful with older browsers or newer functionality, but they have some costs:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>More code to download</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Using libraries increases the amount of JavaScript the browser has to load. Whether it’s bundled with your app or loaded separately from a content delivery network (CDN), your browser still has to download it. This translates into potentially longer loading times and higher battery usage on mobile devices.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Increased risk</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Open source libraries, even popular ones, can be abandoned. When bugs or security vulnerabilities are found, there’s no guarantee of an update. Browsers, in &#13;
<span class="keep-together">general,</span> are supported by large companies (the major browsers are from Google, Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft), and it’s more likely that these issues will be &#13;
<span class="keep-together">fixed.</span></p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This isn’t to say that third-party libraries are <em>bad</em>. There are many benefits as well, especially if you need to support older browsers. Like everything in software development, library use is a balancing act.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is intended for software developers with some experience with JavaScript who want to get the most out of the web platform.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It assumes that you have a good knowledge of the JavaScript language itself: syntax, language features, and standard library functions. You should also have a working knowledge of the DOM APIs used for building interactive, browser-based JavaScript applications.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There is a wide range of recipes in this book; there’s something for developers of all skill and experience levels.</p>&#13;

<p>Each chapter contains a set of <em>recipes</em>—code examples for accomplishing a specific task. Each recipe has three sections:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Problem</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Describes the problem the recipe solves.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Solution</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Contains code and explanation that implements the recipe solution.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Discussion</dt>&#13;

<p>A deeper discussion of the topic. This section may contain additional code examples and comparisons with other techniques.</p>&#13;

<p>Different APIs have different standards, but most can be found either from the <a href="https://oreil.ly/PR0x7">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</a> or the <a href="https://oreil.ly/dFokl">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>First of all, a heartfelt thanks to my family and friends for supporting me, especially to my wife, Liz, and son, Benjamin, for putting up with listening to my incessant typing. When I am in the zone, I tend to type very quickly and loudly.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you to Amanda Quinn, Senior Content Acquisitions Editor, for bringing me on as an O’Reilly author. I’ve read countless O’Reilly books over the years and never thought I’d be writing one of my own one day. Thanks also to Louise Corrigan for making the introduction to Amanda and getting the process started (and who worked with me some years back publishing my very first book!).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Special thanks to Virginia Wilson, Senior Development Editor, for guiding me throughout the process of writing the book and meeting regularly to keep things on track.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’d also like to thank the fantastic technical reviewers on this book: Martine Dowden, Schalk Neethling, Sarah Shook, and Adam Scott. The book turned out far better with their helpful feedback.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lastly, I’d like to give a shout out to the teams designing and developing these modern web APIs. Without them, this book would not exist!</p>&#13;
