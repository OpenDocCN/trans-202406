<p><strong>JavaScript gives you superpowers</strong>. The <strong>true programming language</strong> of the web, JavaScript lets you <strong>add behavior</strong> to your web pages. No more dry, boring, static pages that just sit there looking at you—with JavaScript, you’ll be able to reach out and touch your users, react to interesting events, grab data from the web to use in your pages, draw graphics right in your web pages and a lot more. And once you know JavaScript you’ll also be in a position to create <strong>totally new</strong> behaviors for your users.</p>
<p>You’ll be in good company too. JavaScript’s not only one of the <strong>most popular</strong> programming languages, it’s also <strong>supported</strong> in all modern browsers and is used in many environments outside of the browser. More on that later; for now, let’s get started!</p>

<h1>The way JavaScript works</h1>
<p>If you’re used to creating structure, content, layout and style in your web pages, isn’t it time you add a little behavior as well? After all, there’s no need for the page to just <em>sit there</em>. Great pages should be <em>interative</em> and <em>dynamic</em>. That’s where JavaScript comes in. Let’s start by taking a look at how JavaScript fits into the <em>web page ecosystem</em>:</p>

<h1>How you’re going to write JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript is fairly unique in the programming world. With your typical programming language you have to write it, compile it, link it and deploy it. JavaScript is much more fluid and flexible. With JavaScript all you need to do is write JavaScript right into your page, and then load it into a browser. From there, the browser will happily begin executing your code. Let’s take a closer look at how this works:</p>

<h1>How to get JavaScript into your page</h1>
<p>First things first. You can’t get very far with JavaScript if you don’t know how to get it into a web page. So, how do you do that? Using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element of course!</p>
<p>Let’s take a boring old, garden-variety web page and add some dynamic behavior using a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element. Now, at this point, don’t worry too much about the details of what we’re putting into the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element—your goal right now is to get some JavaScript working.</p>

<h1>there are no Dumb Questions</h1>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> I’ve heard JavaScript is a bit of a wimpy language. Is it?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> JavaScript certainly wasn’t a power lifter in its early days, but its importance to the web has grown since then, and as a result, many resources (including brain power from some of the best minds in the business) have gone into supercharging the performance of JavaScript. But, you know what? Even before JavaScript was super fast, it was always a brilliant language. As you’ll see, we’re going to do some very powerful things with it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> Is JavaScript related to Java?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Only by name. JavaScript was created during a time when Java was a red hot popular language, and the inventors of JavaScript capitalized on that popularity by making use of the Java name. Both languages borrow some syntax from programming languages like C, but other than that, they are quite different.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> Is JavaScript the best way to create dynamic web pages? Are there other technologies?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Not really. JavaScript is <strong>the</strong> language for programming in the browser. There are variants of JavaScript, like TypeScript, but those are not in common use, and even then the TypeScript code you write will be translated into JavaScript before it runs in the browser. With today’s super fast JavaScript enviroments and sophisticated APIs, JavaScript is here to stay and is the standard for programming in the browser.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> My friend is using JavaScript inside a music application, or at least he says he is. Is that possible?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Yes, JavaScript is breaking out of the browser as a general scripting language for many applications from graphics utilities to music applications and even to server-side programming. Your investment in learning JavaScript is likely to pay off in ways beyond web pages in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> You say that many other languages are compiled. What exactly does that mean and why isn’t JavaScript?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> With conventional programming languages like C, C++ or Java, you compile the code before you execute it. Compiling takes your code and produces a machine efficient representation of it, usually optimized for runtime performance. Scripting languages are typically interpreted, which means that the browser runs each line of JavaScript code as it gets to it. Scripting languages place less importance on runtime performance, and are more geared towards tasks like prototyping, interactive coding and flexibility. This was the case with early JavaScript, and was why, for many years, the performance of JavaScript was not so great. There is a middle ground however; an interpreted language can be compiled on the fly, and that’s the path browser manufacturers have taken with modern JavaScript. In fact, with JavaScript you now have the conveniences of a scripting language, while enjoying the performance of a compiled language. By the way, we’ll use the words <em>interpret</em>, <em>evaluate</em> and <em>execute</em> in this book. They have slightly different meanings in various contexts, but for our purposes, they all basically mean the same thing.</p>

<p>With HTML and CSS you can create some great looking pages. But once you know JavaScript, you can really expand on the kinds of pages you can create.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#636467">Knowing JavaScript might increase the size of your paycheck too!</span></p>
</div>
<p>So much so, in fact, you might actually start thinking of your pages as applications (or even experiences!) rather than mere pages.</p>
<p>Now, you might be saying, “I already know that, why do you think I’m reading this book?” Well, we actually wanted to use this opportunity to have a little chat about learning JavaScript. If you already have a programming language or scripting language under your belt, then you have some idea of what lies ahead. However, if you’ve mostly been using HTML &amp; CSS to date, you should know that there is something fundamentally different about learning a programming language.</p>
<p>With HTML &amp; CSS what you’re doing is largely declarative—for instance, you’re declaring, say, that some text is a paragraph or that all the HTML elements in the “sale” class should be colored red. With JavaScript you’re adding <em>behavior</em> to the page, and to do that you need to describe computation. You’ll need to be able to describe things like, “compute the user’s score by summing up all the correct answers” or “do this action ten times” or “when the user clicks on that button play the you-have-won sound” or even “go off and get my latest tweet, and put it in this page.”</p>
<p>To do those things you need a language that is quite different from HTML or CSS. Let’s see how...</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="How to make a statement"><div class="sect1" id="how_to_make_a_statement">
<h1>How to make a statement</h1>
<p>When you create HTML you usually <strong>mark upg</strong> text to give it structure; to do that you add elements, attributes and values to the text:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/f0010-01.png" alt="Image" width="936" height="132"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>CSS is a bit different. With CSS you’re writing a set of <strong>rules</strong>, where each rule selects elements in the page, and then specifies a set of styles for those elements:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/f0010-02.png" alt="Image" width="738" height="244"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>With JavaScript you write <strong>statements</strong>. Each statement specifies a small part of a computation, and together, all the statements create the behavior of the page:</p>

<h6></h6>

</div></section>
<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Variables and values"><div class="sect1" id="variables_and_values">
<h1>Variables and values</h1>
<p>You might have noticed that JavaScript statements usually involve variables. Variables are used to store values. What kinds of values? Here are a few examples:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/f0011-01.png" alt="Image" width="824" height="383"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>There are other values that variables can hold beyond numbers, strings and booleans, and we’ll get to those soon enough, but, no matter what a variable contains, we create all variables the same way. Let’s take a little closer look at how to declare a variable:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/f0011-02.png" alt="Image" width="649" height="288"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>We say optionally, because if you want, you can create a variable without an initial value, and then assign it a value later. To create a variable without an initial value, just leave off the assignment part, like this:</p>

<p>What value do you think JavaScript is assigning to this variable?</p>
</div></aside>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Constants, another kind of variable"><div class="sect1" id="constantscomma_another_kind_of_variable">
<h1>Constants, another kind of variable</h1>
<p>So far, we’ve used the keyword <code><strong>let</strong></code> to declare our variables. And that’s typically what we want to do with variables whose values can <em>vary,</em> or in other words, change their value over time. For instance, if we use <code>let</code> to declare the variable <code><strong>winners</strong></code>, assign it the value 2, we can change the value in <code>winners</code> later to be 3 if another winner comes along:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/f0012-03.png" alt="Image" width="838" height="327"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>Sometimes, however, we do not want the values in our variables to vary at all. There are situations in which we might want to give a name to a value that we’ll use in our code, but we don’t ever want that value to change. Here’s a good example: the radius of planet Earth. It might be handy to assign this value to a variable so we can use <code><strong>EARTH_RADIUS</strong></code> instead of the number in our code. We don’t want anyone to come along and change this value accidentally, so how can we make sure the value of <code>EARTH_RADIUS</code> never changes? We can use a <em>constant</em> instead of a variable, like this:</p>

<h1>Back away from that keyboard!</h1>
<p>You know variables have a name, and you know they have a value.</p>
<p>You also know some of the things a variable can hold are numbers, strings and boolean values.</p>
<p><em><strong>But what can you call your variables? Is any name okay?</strong></em> Well no, but the rules around creating variable names are simple: just follow the two rules below to create valid variable names:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="assets/f0014-00.png" alt="Image" width="20" height="20"/></span> <strong>Start your variables with a letter, an underscore or a dollar sign.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="assets/f0014-00a.png" alt="Image" width="20" height="20"/></span> <strong>After that, use as many letters, numeric digits, underscores or dollar signs as you like.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and one more thing; we really don’t want to confuse JavaScript by using any of the built-in <em>keywords</em>, like <strong>let</strong> or <strong>function</strong> or <strong>false</strong>, so consider those off limits for your own variable names. We’ll get to some of these keywords and what they mean throughout the rest of the book, but here’s a list to take a quick look at:</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> What’s a keyword?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> A keyword is a reserved word in JavaScript. JavaScript uses these reserved words for its own purposes, and it would be confusing to you and the browser if you started using them for your variables and constants.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> The var keyword is no longer recommended and has been largely replaced by let and const. These keywords work slightly differently to var and have some benefits over var that we’ll come back to later.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> What if I used a keyword as part of my variable name? For instance, can I have a variable named ifOnly (that is, a variable that contains the keyword if)?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> You sure can, just don’t match the keyword exactly. It’s also good to write clear code, so in general you wouldn’t want to use something like <code>elze</code>, which might be confused with <code>else</code>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> Is JavaScript case sensitive? In other words, are myvariable and MyVariable the same thing?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> If you’re used to HTML markup you might be used to case insensitive languages; after all, &lt;head&gt; and &lt;HEAD&gt; are treated the same by the browser. With JavaScript however, case matters for variables, constants, keywords, function names and pretty much everything else, too. So pay attention to your use of upper- and lowercase.</p>

<h1>Express yourself</h1>
<p>To truly express yourself in JavaScript you need <em><strong>expressions</strong></em>. Expressions evaluate to values. You’ve already seen a few in passing in our code examples. Take the expression in this statement for instance:</p>

<p>If you’ve ever taken a math class, balanced your checkbook or done your taxes, we’re sure these kinds of numeric expressions are nothing new.</p>
<p>There are also string expressions; here are a few:</p>

<p>And expressions can evaluate to a few other types; we’ll get to these later in the book. For now, the important thing is to realize all these expressions evaluate to something: a value that is a number, a string or a boolean. Let’s keep moving and see what that gets you!</p>

<p>Did you notice that the = operator is used in assignments, while the == operator tests for equality? That is, we use one equal sign to assign values to variables. We use two equal signs to test if two values are equal to each other. Substituting one for the other is a common coding mistake.</p>

<p><em>Wax on, wax off</em>...</p>
<p><em>Eat candies from the bowl until they’re all gone.</em></p>
<p>Of course you’ll often need to do things in code more than once, and JavaScript gives you a few ways to repeatedly execute code in a loop: <strong>while</strong>, <strong>for</strong>, <strong>for in</strong> and <strong>forEach</strong>. Eventually, we’ll look at all these ways of looping, but let’s focus on <strong>while</strong> for now.</p>
<p>We just talked about expressions that evaluate to boolean values, like <code>scoops &gt; 0</code>, and these kinds of expressions are the key to the while statement. Here’s how:</p>

<h1>Making decisions with JavaScript</h1>
<p>You’ve just seen how you use a conditional to decide whether to continue looping in a <code>while</code> statement. You can also use boolean expressions to make decisions in JavaScript with the <code>if</code> statement. The <code>if</code> statement executes its code block only if a conditional test is true. Here’s an example:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/f0024-01.png" alt="Image" width="907" height="293"/>

<h1>there are no Dumb Questions</h1>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> What exactly is a code block?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Syntactically, a code block (which we usually just call a block) is a set of statements, which could be one statement, or as many as you like, grouped together between curly braces. Once you’ve got a block of code, all the statements in that block are treated as a group to be executed together in sequence. For instance, all the statements within the block in a while statement are executed if the condition of the while is true. The same holds for a block in an if or else if.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> I’ve seen code where the conditional is a variable with a value that isn’t a boolean, like a string or a number. How does that work?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> We’ll be covering that a little later, but the short answer is JavaScript is quite flexible in what it thinks is a true or false value. For instance, any variable that holds a (non-empty) string is considered true, but a variable that hasn’t been set to a value is considered false. We’ll get into these details soon enough.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> You’ve said that expressions can result in things other than numbers, strings and booleans. Like what?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Right now we’re concentrating on what are known as the <em>primitive types</em>, that is, numbers, strings and booleans. Later we’ll take a look at more complex types, like arrays, which are collections of values, objects and functions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> Where does the name boolean come from?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Booleans are named after George Boole, an English mathematician who invented Boolean logic. You’ll often see boolean written “Boolean,” to signify that these types of variables are named after George.</p>

<h1>Reach out and communicate with your user</h1>
<p>We’ve been talking about making your pages more interactive, and to do that you need to be able to communicate with your user. As it turns out there are a few ways to do that, and you’ve already seen some of them. Let’s get a quick overview and then we’ll dive into these in more detail throughout the book:</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Create an alert"><div class="sect2" id="create_an_alert">
<h2>Create an alert</h2>
<p>As you’ve seen, the browser gives you a quick way to alert your users through the <code>alert</code> function. Just call <code>alert</code> with a string containing your alert message, and the browser will give your user the message in a nice dialog box. A small confession though: we’ve been overusing this because it’s easy; <code>alert</code> really should be used only when you truly want to stop everything and let the user know something.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Write directly into your document"><div class="sect2" id="write_directly_into_your_document">
<h2>Write directly into your document</h2>
<p>Think of your web page as a document (that’s what the browser calls it). You can use a function <code>document.write</code> to write arbitrary HTML and content into your page at any point. In general, this is considered bad form, although you’ll see it used here and there. We’ve used it a bit in this chapter too because it’s an easy way to get started.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Use the console"><div class="sect2" id="use_the_console">
<h2>Use the console</h2>
<p>Every JavaScript environment also has a console that can log messages from your code. To write a message to the console’s log you use the function <code>console.log</code> and hand it a string that you’d like printed to the log (more details on using console log in a second). You can view <code>console.log</code> as a great tool for troubleshooting your code, but typically your users will never see your console log, so it’s not a very effective way to communicate with them.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#636467">The console is a really handy way to help find errors in your code! If you’ve made a typing mistake, like missing a quote, JavaScript will usually give you an error in the console to help you track it down.</span></p>

<h2>Directly manipulate your document</h2>
<p>This is the big leagues; this is the way you want to be interacting with your page and users—using JavaScript you can access your actual web page, read &amp; change its content, and even alter its structure and style! This all happens by making use of your browser’s <em>document object model</em> (more on that later). As you’ll see, this is the best way to communicate with your user. But, using the document object model requires knowledge of how your page is structured and of the programming interface that is used to read and write to the page. We’ll be getting there soon enough. But first, we’ve got some more JavaScript to learn.</p>

Remember though, the console is not a browser feature most casual users of the web will encounter, so you won’t want to use it in the final version of your web page. Writing to the console log is typically done to troubleshoot as you develop your page. That said, it’s a great way to see what your code is doing while you’re learning the basics of JavaScript.

<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> I get that console.log can be used to output strings, but what exactly is it? I mean why are the “console” and the “log” seperated by a period?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Ah, good point. We’re jumping ahead a bit, but think of the console as an object that does things, console-like things. One of those things is logging, and to tell the console to log for us, we use the syntax “console.log” and pass it our output in between parentheses. Keep that in the back of your mind; we’re coming back to talk a lot more about objects a little later in the book. For now, you’ve got enough to use console.log.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> Can the console do anything other than just log?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Yes, but typically people just use it to log. There are a few more advanced ways to use log (and console), but they tend to be browser-specific. Note that console is something all modern browsers supply, but it isn’t part of any formal specification.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> Uh, console looks great, but where do I find it? I’m using it in my code and I don’t see any output!</strong></p>

<p>Every browser has a slightly different implementation of the console. And, to make things even more complicated, the way that browsers implement the console changes fairly frequently—not in a huge way, but enough so that by the time you read this, your browser’s console might look a bit different from what we’re showing here.</p>
<p>So, we’re going to show you how to access the console in the Chrome browser (version 120) on the Mac, and we’ll put instructions on how to access the console in all the major browsers online at <a href="http://wickedlysmart.com/hfjsconsole">http://wickedlysmart.com/hfjsconsole</a>. Once you get the hang of the console in one browser, it’s fairly easy to figure out how to use it in other browsers too, and we encourage you to try using the console in at least two browsers so you’re familiar with them.</p>

<h1>How do I add code to my page? (let me count the ways)</h1>
<p>You already know you can add the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element with your JavaScript code to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of your page, but there are a couple of other ways to add your code to a page. Let’s check out all the places you can put JavaScript (and why you might want to put it one place over another):</p>

<h1>We’re going to have to separate you two</h1>
<p>Going separate ways hurts, but we know we have to do it. It’s time to take your JavaScript and move it into its own file. Here’s how you do that...</p>

<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Welcome JavaScript. We know you’re super-busy out there, working on all those web pages, so we’re glad you could take time out to talk to us.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> No problem. And, I <em>am</em> busier than ever these days; people are using JavaScript on just about every page on the Web nowadays, for everything from simple menu effects to full blown games. It’s nuts!</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> That’s amazing given that just a few years ago, someone said that you were just a “half-baked, wimpy scripting language” and now you’re everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Don’t remind me. I’ve come a long way since then, and many great minds have been hard at work making me better.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Better how? Seems like your basic language features are about the same...</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Well, I’m better in a couple of ways. First of all, I’m lightning fast these days. While I’m considered a scripting language, now my performance is close to that of native compiled languages.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> And second?</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> My ability to do things in the browser has expanded dramatically. Using the JavaScript libraries available in all modern browsers you can find out your location, play video and audio, paint graphics on your web page and a lot more. But if you wanna do all that you have to know JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> But back to those criticisms of you, the language. I’ve heard some not so kind words... I believe the phrase was “hacked up language.”</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> I’ll stand on my record. I’m pretty much one of, if not <em>the</em> most widely used languages in the world. I’ve also fought off many competitors and won. Remember Java in the browser? Ha, what a joke. VBScript? Ha. JScript? Flash?! Silverlight? I could go on and on. So, tell me, how bad could I be?</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> You’ve been criticized as, well, “simplistic.”</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Honestly, it’s my greatest strength. The fact that you can fire up a browser, type in a few lines of JavaScript and be off and running, that’s powerful. And it’s great for beginners too. I’ve heard some say there’s no better beginning language than JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> But simplicity comes at a cost, no?</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Well that’s the great thing, I’m simple in the sense you can get a quick start. But I’m deep and full of all the latest modern programming constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Oh, like what?</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Well, for example, can you say dynamic types, first-class functions and closures?</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> I can say it but I don’t know what they are.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Figures... that’s okay, if you stay with the book you will get to know them.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Well, give us the gist.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Let me just say this, JavaScript was built to live in a dynamic web environment, an exciting environment where users interact with a page, where data is coming in on the fly, where many types of events happen, and the language reflects that style of programming. You’ll get it a little more a bit later in the book when you understand JavaScript more.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Okay, to hear you tell it, you’re the perfect language. Is that right?</p>
<p><em>JavaScript tears up...</em></p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> You know, I didn’t grow up within the ivy-covered walls of academia like most languages. I was born into the real world and had to sink or swim very fast in my life. Given that, I’m not perfect; I certainly have a few “rough spots.”</p>
<p><strong>Head First with a slight Barbara Walters smile:</strong> We’ve seen a new side of you today. I think this merits another interview in the future.</p>

<h1>Bullet Points</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>JavaScript is used to add <strong>behavior</strong> to web pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Browser engines are much faster at executing JavaScript than they were just a few years ago.</p></li>
<li><p>Browsers begin executing JavaScript code as soon as they encounter the code in the page.</p></li>
<li><p>Add JavaScript to your page with the <strong>&lt;script&gt;</strong> element.</p></li>
<li><p>You can put your JavaScript inline in the web page, or link to a separate file containing your JavaScript from your HTML.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <strong>src</strong> attribute in the &lt;script&gt; tag to link to a separate JavaScript file.</p></li>
<li><p>HTML <strong>declares</strong> the structure and content of your page; JavaScript <strong>computes</strong> values and adds behavior to your page.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript programs are made up of a series of <strong>statements</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the most common JavaScript statements is a variable declaration, which uses the <strong>let</strong> keyword to declare a new variable and the assignment operator, <strong>=,</strong> to assign a value to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>const</strong> to assign a value that shouldn’t change.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of a constant doesn’t vary, so we call them constants, not variables.</p></li>
<li><p>There are just a few rules and guidelines for naming JavaScript variables and constants, and it’s important that you follow them.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to avoid JavaScript keywords when naming variables.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript expressions compute values.</p></li>
<li><p>Three common types of expressions are <strong>numeric</strong>, <strong>string</strong> and <strong>boolean</strong> expressions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>if/else</strong> statements allow you to make decisions in your code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>while/for</strong> statements allow you to execute code many times by looping.</p></li>
<li><p>You can group statements together into a code <strong>block</strong> by enclosing them in curley braces.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <strong>console.log</strong> instead of <strong>alert</strong> to display messages to the console.</p></li>
<li><p>Console messages should be used primarily for troubleshooting as users will most likely never see console messages.</p></li>
<li><p>JavaScript is most commonly found adding behavior to web pages, but is also used to script many creative applications, and is used as a server-side programming language with node. js.</p></li>
