<h1><span class="label">Chapter 15. </span>Making Career Moves</h1>
<p>Sure, our parents or grandparents might have started <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_career"/>a job right out of high school or college, stayed with it for thirty or more years, and then retired, but that just isn’t the way careers go these days. And by <em>these days</em>, I mean for the past thirty years. In the various technology-related careers, it’s rare to find anyone in the same position with the same company for over five years.</p>
<p>From personal experience, I worked for EDS and HP for sixteen years, but I held several positions within each company during that time. Most of my jobs lasted from eighteen months to two-and-a-half years. It was prudent to switch roles often, although all were lateral moves, and I grew and learned in each one. I worked for the same manager three or more times during my tenure at EDS and HP. We both moved around inside the company and kept crossing paths. It seemed that managers moved around as often as regular employees. In those days of massive and continuous layoffs, it was wise to be a moving target.</p>
<p>These days, career moves aren’t seen as unfavorable. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="desirability of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871638704"/>One recruiter told me that some managers and companies view a technical person who doesn’t make a move every eighteen to twenty-four months as less desirable as a potential candidate. I’m unconvinced that this is true. There’s something to be said for someone stable enough to stay put for a few years and become competent in every aspect of their job. But you will, at some point, find yourself looking for a new job in system administration. This chapter explores the various ways to find employment, upgrade your job, and go after those highly desirable “dream” positions.</p>
<section class="pagebreak-before" data-pdf-bookmark="Starting Your Own Business" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="starting_your_own_business">
<h1 class="less_space">Starting Your Own Business</h1>
<p>Have you ever thought of quitting <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starting your own business" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_strtbus"/>your job and starting <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="starting your own business" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_careerstrt"/>your own tech business? The desire for more money, or autonomy, leads you to conclude you can do it better, faster, or cheaper yourself. Or, maybe the thought of “being your own boss” appeals to you. For system administrators, being in business for yourself points to consulting, teaching, or freelancing. In all cases, it means directly selling your skills to companies. Not to be discouraging, but there are some things you need to know before you quit your job and embark on this new adventure.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Facing Self-Employment Realities" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="facing_self_employment_realities">
<h2>Facing Self-Employment Realities</h2>
<p>The primary reality you must face as an entrepreneur is that you are never your own boss. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starting your own business" data-secondary="facing self-employment realities" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871580928"/>Every customer is your boss. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="self-employment realities, facing" data-seealso="starting  your own business" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657874674336"/>When you work in a company, you generally have one manager to whom you report. Not so when you work for yourself. Your job now is to attract new customers and retain your current customers. You don’t get to call in sick when you feel under the weather, you don’t get to take a lot of time off for vacation, and your benefits are entirely your responsibility. This is to say, running a business is hard work.</p>
<p>If these realities of self-employment don’t deter your interest, and you do decide to start your own business, one of your first steps should be to acquire insurance to protect yourself. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="indemnification policies" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871561680"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871619072"/>Some insurance companies sell errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance or some other indemnification policy to protect you against fraud, mistakes, and unhappy customers. Many community colleges offer business startup classes or small business management courses that you can take to test your venture’s efficacy.</p>
<p>You should also incorporate your business either as an S corporation or a limited liability company (LLC). <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="S corporations" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871888848"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="limited liability company (LLC)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657874389904"/>It’s easy to do. If you need help, there is help available online, at the State Department, and from friends, consultants, attorneys, financial advisors, and accountants.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Managing Employees" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="managing_employees">
<h2>Managing Employees</h2>
<p>If you thought being <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starting your own business" data-secondary="managing employees" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871640592"/>an employee was difficult, imagine<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="employees" data-secondary="managing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871556656"/> managing employees. Dealing with vacations, sick leave, mistakes, customer care, and coworker interaction are all part of employee management. I advise you to state your expectations verbally and in writing before an employee begins work. You may do this via an employee handbook, one-on-one meetings, or other written and verbal communication forms. You should also have periodic meetings to give feedback on employee performance. Set up monthly or biweekly meetings to discuss expectations, performance, and employee issues. The number one complaint among employees is lack of communication. Don’t let it happen on your watch if you’ve been there yourself.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to manage payroll, taxes, and employee benefits. Engage a bookkeeping service, payroll service, or accountant to handle these tasks. Additionally, you must consider cost-of-living pay raises, bonuses, and compensatory (comp) time.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Hiring Contractors" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="hiring_contractors">
<h2>Hiring Contractors</h2>
<p>You can operate your business without employees.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starting your own business" data-secondary="hiring contractors" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872586880"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="contractors, hiring" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872224768"/> Contract labor is more expensive than employees, but you don’t manage vacations, comp time, bonuses, sick leave, or most other aspects of the employer/employee relationship. You still must deal with compensation and taxes for contractors. You must also set expectations for customer care and performance.</p>
<p>The primary <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="employees" data-secondary="contractors versus" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871821344"/>problem with contract <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="contractors, hiring" data-secondary="employees versus contractors" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871958720"/>labor is that you have no control over their time, and control is the determining factor of whether someone is an employee or a contractor. Use caution when dictating working parameters so you don’t cross the contractor/employee line. Get the advice of an attorney or tax accountant for rules governing contractors versus employees. Having contractors reclassified as employees by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expensive and detrimental to your business. Always engage professional advice for this aspect of your business. The IRS or a qualified accountant will assist you in classifying resources as employees or <span class="keep-together">contractors.</span></p>
<p>As you can see, operating a business isn’t as simple as printing business cards and hiring yourself out as a contractor. There are many facets to running a business, even if it’s a sole proprietorship. You need to seriously consider taxes, deductible expenses, profits, labor rates, medical benefits, and personal time before quitting your day job.</p>
<p>Many technology workers have started businesses and enjoyed challenges, successes, and failures. You’ve heard success stories of how a tech person started a business, sold that business, and is now retired or on to some new venture. You’ve also heard of those who try running their own companies only to return to corporate life as an employee. Don’t worry; no negative stigmas are associated with going into business and returning to corporate life. Being in business is hard; it’s not for everyone, and employers understand this.</p>
<p>The following section discusses moving into corporate management should you decide that being an employee is more to your liking.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starting your own business" data-startref="ix_strtbus" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871662944"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="starting your own business" data-startref="ix_careerstrt" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871661856"/></p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Moving into Corporate Management" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="moving_into_corporate_management">
<h1>Moving into Corporate Management</h1>
<p>As a sysadmin, you’ve thought about moving from the bottom of the food chain to the corporate ladder. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="corporate management, moving into" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_corpmgt"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="moving into corporate management" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_careercorpmgt"/>I considered it multiple times during my sysadmin years. Would I take a job in management and leave my technical life behind? That’s a good question; you’ll have to answer it at least once during your career.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Challenging Yourself" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="challenging_yourself">
<h2>Challenging Yourself</h2>
<p>I believe that many <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="corporate management, moving into" data-secondary="challenging yourself" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871600560"/>sysadmins, myself included, think that managers don’t understand what we do but realize that we’re an essential part of the organization. We are the <em>doers</em> of the org chart. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="managers, role of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871642384"/>A senior manager once told me (and I’m quoting here), “I don’t <em>do</em> anything, but I get things done.” I’m sure he saw my eyebrows raise as if to say, “Yeah, I know. We all know.” He didn’t respond to my unsubtle reaction to his statement. He did have a point, though. The issue was that he wasn’t employed to push buttons, pull levers, or reboot computers, but he was in a place to ensure someone pulled those levers and pushed those buttons. You see, management is a different perspective. Managers carry orders from above and get credit for their direct reports. The managers, in turn, are supposed to reward their achievers.</p>
<p>Being a manager isn’t easy. A lot of corporate responsibility rests on your shoulders, but the real rewards are dispersed above your pay grade for your work via direct reports. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="playing politics" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872190896"/>Managers have to “play politics,” which means they must strike a balance between the people on the front lines, such as the help desk technicians, desktop technicians, sysadmins, network admins, database administrators, and so on. These direct reports may be overworked, disgruntled, and underappreciated. At the same time, your manager’s managers have no clue what the people at the bottom of the food chain do to keep the wheels of business turning.</p>
<p>Perhaps, like the captain of a ship, the upper-level managers don’t need to row the boat nor care how you do it, but they need to ensure that it happens on demand and at the required pace. I don’t like it, but I understand it.</p>
<p>Before you move into management or entertain the idea of moving into management, you’ll have to weigh the costs against the benefits. One of the costs is your relationship with your former coworkers. It might not matter how long you spent in the trenches, because once you put on your management cap, your former colleagues might perceive you differently.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Managing Your New Role" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="managing_your_new_role">
<h2>Managing Your New Role</h2>
<p>If your company offers management courses, take them. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="corporate management, moving into" data-secondary="managing your new role" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872349168"/>These courses will teach you some generic management rules, but what you’re looking for are <em>corporate culture</em> items. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="corporate culture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872347456"/>No matter the size, every company has its own corporate culture, and you must learn to navigate it. Training classes will help prepare you for your new role.</p>
<p>The next step in managing your new role is to request mentorship from a senior-level manager. Asking for mentorship will do multiple things for you. The first is that it puts you in the spotlight as someone who realizes the value of having a mentor. Second, you will have an automatic career advocate (your mentor), and you need an advocate to help you achieve your career goals. Third, it allows you to learn people management, corporate culture, and your organization from the top down. If you’re a parent, how did you learn to be one? Perhaps from observing your parents. I recommend you learn from multiple managers to see different ways of managing people and decide for yourself on the best combination of techniques. Learn from someone who is not necessarily in your chain of command.</p>
<p>The remainder of this chapter provides some general advice that works for most technology positions, not limited to system administration. While the information here is somewhat generic, I believe you’ll find value in it because it will help you enjoy a more productive, peaceful, and forward-moving career.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="corporate management, moving into" data-startref="ix_corpmgt" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871639504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="moving into corporate management" data-startref="ix_careercorpmgt" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871515088"/></p>

<h1>Changing with the Job Market</h1>
<p>I once had a job recruiter tell me that open Linux system administrator jobs are rare and undervalued in the market. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_jobmkt"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="changing with the job market" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_careerjobmkt"/>That was undoubtedly his experience in the city where we both lived at the time, but it isn’t true for the national job market. Linux system administrators enjoy a good job market and have for many years. For sysadmins with at least five years of experience, you can find your choice of positions with excellent salaries.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="changing with the job market" data-see="job market, changing with" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871551776"/></p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national job market in the US changes from year to year, but the outlook is still solid. The projection for Network and Computer Systems Administrators (the closest match I could find) is 5% growth over the coming ten years, with a median salary of just under $85,000 per year. This information is outdated, although the reported date is May 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the job market for technology professionals. One thing that has come from the pandemic is remote work. Before March 2020, most companies required employees to work in a physical office. This is no longer the case. Remote work is the new normal. And because it’s the new normal, you must discipline yourself, make the most of conference calls and instant messaging, and excel at your job. In the following sections, you learn how to navigate online job boards, maintain focus during the workday, and work appropriately using conferencing and collaboration tools.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Searching Online Job Boards" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="searching_online_job_boards">
<h2>Searching Online Job Boards</h2>
<p>Finding a job online is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="changing with the job market" data-tertiary="searching online job boards" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_careerjobmktsrchbd"/>nothing new, but job <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="searching online job boards" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_jobmktsrchbd"/>boards have evolved dramatically in the last few decades. Job boards provide job seekers with listings by keyword search and include interviewing tips, résumé writing tips, job skills tests, and other educational opportunities for subscribers. I use four sites when looking for jobs for myself or helping other technology professionals find a job: LinkedIn, FlexJobs, Monster, and Indeed. Mentioning these sites here is not an endorsement, nor is the omission of other services a negative review of them. These are the sites I use.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Professional networking via LinkedIn" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="professional_networking_via_linkedin">
<h3>Professional networking via LinkedIn</h3>
<p>Finding a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="searching online job boards" data-tertiary="professional networking via LinkedIn" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871486080"/>job that<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="LinkedIn, professional networking via" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657874117216"/> fits your skills and aspirations on <a href="https://oreil.ly/jn0Zs">LinkedIn</a> can be easier than on other job-only sites because LinkedIn uses your professional profile and résumé to build job search results and recommended job lists. LinkedIn is a social networking site where you can create your personal profile, connect with others, join groups, post information, search for job postings, and chat in real time with your connections.</p>
<p>LinkedIn includes several career tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Job alerts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salary surveys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skill assessments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interview preparation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Résumé builder</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has a learning platform that you can subscribe to in order to gain knowledge or enhance your current skills through online training. You can also subscribe to LinkedIn’s premium service, which offers more tools and services for job seekers. If you want your job search to remain private, you can enable recruiters to see that you’re available without announcing to the world that you’re looking for a new job. I’ve personally had great success with LinkedIn, and I highly recommend that you develop your profile and start making connections.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Finding a better way to work with FlexJobs" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="finding_a_better_way_to_work_with_flexj">
<h3>Finding a better way to work with FlexJobs</h3>
<p>I’ve held a <a href="https://oreil.ly/aKRdQ">FlexJobs</a> membership for several years (since 2014), primarily to search for freelance writing positions. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="searching online job boards" data-tertiary="finding better way to work with FlexJobs" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871483408"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="FlexJobs, finding better way to work with" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871455040"/>But FlexJobs is more than a simple job search platform. It has some compelling features that I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Job alerts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A learning center</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career advice</p>
</li>

<p>Articles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seminars and web events</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low cost ($50 per year)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For job seekers, the low cost and high value of FlexJobs get you a lot for a little. There are thousands of jobs available for all types of work. If you’re looking for freelance or part-time employment, it’s there. There are many high-paying remote and flexible location jobs on this site. It runs the entire range of positions from entry-level and unskilled to C-level executive positions.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Finding the right fit with Monster" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="finding_the_right_fit_with_monster">
<h3>Finding the right fit with Monster</h3>
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/v3DrX">Monster</a> is the oldest online job search tool that I remember using. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="searching online job boards" data-tertiary="finding right fit with Monster" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872168960"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Monster, finding the right job fit with" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871438768"/>Many people use it and readily find jobs through it. Daily, I receive emails for open positions based on my résumé on Monster. In many ways, it’s a bit behind the times because it doesn’t have the richness of design and the number of tools that other sites do. It does have the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Job search</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salary tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career advice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Articles and links to other resources</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you upload your résumé on Monster, you will immediately receive listings for jobs related to your career. Doing so can be helpful if you’d rather have some of the work done by recruiting agencies. The jobs I receive through Monster are mostly contract and contract-to-hire types, which I’m not interested in receiving. I need to turn off those notifications because I’m only interested in full-time, long-term employment outside my freelance work. Sign up on Monster, upload your résumé, and allow job notifications to hit your inbox, but don’t use Monster exclusively.</p>

<h3>Searching for jobs at Indeed</h3>
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/kyHou">Indeed</a> bills itself as the #1 job site in the world. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="searching online job boards" data-tertiary="searching for jobs at Indeed" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657873690992"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Indeed, searching for jobs at" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657873693712"/>It’s more than a simple job search engine. Like the other sites listed here, Indeed has career guides and information available. Although most features serve employers, that’s not a bad thing. When you post your résumé and personal data on a site, you want potential employers to find you with as little hassle as possible.</p>
<p>A simple search for “Linux administrator” yields 841 job matches today. What I like most about Indeed are its speed and its transparency. You see everything known about the job as soon as the service displays a job match. For example, on the company’s website, you know the job title, company name, salary, location, job description, and link to apply. No signing up, hassle, third parties, or other barriers exist. And when you’re looking for a job, you don’t want or need barriers, lengthy processes, or runarounds.</p>
<p>Searching for a job requires patience, trial and error, and wading through a lot of job “fluff,” as I refer to it—meaning that some jobs sound good on the surface, but once you click on the description, you realize that you’ve wasted your time. It’s part of the process. But once you’ve found your new position, you must master working remotely. It sounds easy, but it isn’t always. The following section explores working remotely in detail.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="changing with the job market" data-startref="ix_careerjobmktsrchbd" data-tertiary="searching online job boards" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871650176"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="searching online job boards" data-startref="ix_jobmktsrchbd" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871706144"/></p>

<p>At first glance, working<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="working remotely" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871703520"/> from home seems<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="working remotely" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871422320"/> like the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="remote work" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871421344"/> perfect situation, and it can be. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="changing with the job market" data-tertiary="working remotely" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871420240"/>Still, as one former coworker described, it can be a “less than optimal” experience. He meant that the lack of a commute to and from a traditional workplace can compel coworkers, managers, and executives to expect your availability every day, at all hours. He and I spent many 14- and 16-hour days working, on the phone, and at all hours of the night supporting customers to the detriment of our own home life and well-being.</p>
<p>Upper management expected us to work eight hours per day, handle maintenance during “off hours,” and show up ready to work at the usual time the following day. The promise of “comp” time never came to fruition, nor did any bonuses or other perks. That was my experience, though I knew others who did receive comp time, bonuses, and further compensation for their efforts.</p>

<h3>Maintaining focus throughout your workday</h3>
<p>You have to be vigilant about how many hours you spend at your desk. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="focus, maintaining when working remotely" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871647680"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="maintaining focus through your workday" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871412768"/>You must remember to take your breaks, take lunch away from your work desk, and limit your workday to normal and reasonable hours. Don’t feel compelled to work 12-hour days because you can work from home. You need your own time with your family, friends, and yourself.</p>
<p>The other issue that some people have is a lack of focus at home. They’ll do laundry, walk their dogs, go grocery shopping, take long lunches, and abuse the privilege so that everyone becomes the subject of micromanagement. Some of those activities are normal even if you go into an office but don’t overdo them. Stay at your desk. Do your work. When you’re away from your desk, take your phone with you so that your coworkers may contact you in case of outages, questions, or other business-related reasons. There’s no harm in taking a short walk or bike ride rather than multiple short breaks during a day, but be courteous about the time you take, let your coworkers know, and keep your phone handy.</p>
<p>Multiple short breaks or one long one can refresh you during the day. If you recall your activities in the office, you probably had some interactions with coworkers, lunches away from the office, and maybe even had access to an on-campus gym. You’re entitled to these when you work from home as well. Remember that abusing the system hurts everyone. Focus when required and refresh when necessary.</p>

<h2>Learning How to Communicate</h2>
<p>Almost every <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="communication, learning" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_comm"/>job description lists “excellent<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="learning how to communicate" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_jobmktcomm"/> written and <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="changing with the job market" data-tertiary="learning how to communicate" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_careerjobmktcomm"/>verbal communication” as one of the job’s requirements. Not everyone has to be a professional writer or a great public speaker. Still, you should strive to communicate clearly and professionally with your colleagues, clients, and management. Clear communications elevate your position and will enhance your career options. Using sarcasm, anger, too much humor, or a flippant conversational style makes you look unprofessional and unpromotable. It’s not always easy to maintain a professional demeanor, but you must strive to do so.</p>
<p>The following sections focus on communicating using the various tools at your disposal. In electronic communications, meanings can be lost or twisted, so you must learn to share professionally by email, instant messaging/text, and video conference calls.</p>

<h3>Working via video conference and instant messaging</h3>
<p>If you’ve never worked remotely before, you should ready yourself and your computer for conference calls. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="learning how to communicate" data-tertiary="working via video conference and instant messaging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872001888"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="working remotely" data-secondary="via video conference and instant messaging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871653504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="communication, learning" data-secondary="working via video conference and instant messaging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871653248"/>That means you need a camera if you don’t have one connected or installed on your computer. Most newer laptop computers have built-in cameras, but you’ll have to purchase a USB camera if you use a desktop computer. You can use your mobile phone, but the quality and size are not optimal.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>You’ll need to purchase, set up, and test your camera when looking for new positions because interviews now take place via conference calls.</p>
</div>
<p>You can purchase a USB camera for as little as $20 US from online sources. In the following section, I discuss video conferencing as a communication method for job interviews and your job and some guidelines for remote communications etiquette.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Video conference calling" data-type="sect4"><div class="sect4" id="video_conference_calling">
<h4>Video conference calling</h4>
<p>Zoom (and other conference call software) calls <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="video conference calling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872493408"/>have <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="communication, learning" data-secondary="working via video conference and instant messaging" data-tertiary="video conference calling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871628336"/>been commonplace since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. I don’t expect that to change soon, because now many technology-oriented employees feel comfortable working remotely. There are a few dos and don’ts associated with video conferencing calls, and you should know them before interviewing or starting a new job:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be on time for the call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dress appropriately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mute when not speaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look into the camera when speaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid distractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speak clearly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The old saying, “If you’re not early, you’re late,” certainly holds true for conference calls. Joining calls just before they go live is not only courteous but also shows your enthusiasm for your position and lets the call organizer know that you value their time too. Dress and groom appropriately for your call. Pretend you’re in the office and your meetings are “in person.” You don’t have to look like you’re going to a posh affair, but you must look presentable and professional. Remember to mute your microphone when you’re not speaking. It’s distracting to others to have your microphone pick up random noises. You’d be surprised how well even distant sounds come through the call.</p>
<p>Look into the camera rather than at the people you’re talking to on the screen. I know it’s hard to do, but the person looking at you while speaking would rather see you looking back at them rather than peering to one side. You should avoid distractions while you’re on a business call. Perhaps you’ve seen the video of the news anchor broadcasting from home when his children break into his room. The video is funny, and most people are forgiving, but it does have the effect of presenting you as less than professional. You must also focus on the call, avoiding being distracted by email, instant messages, or shopping. Attentiveness is professional and expected.</p>
<p>Speak clearly but don’t shout into the microphone. Others can hear you better when you face the microphone and fully engage in the conversation. If you need to do something else during a call or if you’re interrupted for some reason, be sure that you mute your microphone and turn off your video. You can still listen to the call without distracting others.</p>

<h4>Instant messaging</h4>
<p>When you need <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="instant messaging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871608880"/>to send a <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="communication, learning" data-secondary="working via video conference and instant messaging" data-tertiary="instant messaging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871466560"/>message, ask a question or set up a meeting, email seems too slow when you can simply send an instant message. Instant messaging can be handy, but it can also annoy your coworkers. Be polite and ask if the other person has time to chat with you. Instant messaging is the virtual equivalent of walking up and speaking to someone in their cubicle. Remember that during the workday, your coworkers are busy. Respect their time. Once you’ve engaged the other person, state your purpose or ask your question. Be friendly and concise with your conversations. And remember, instant messaging isn’t private, so be careful what you write in text-based conversations.</p>

<h3>Communicating via email</h3>

Most of us couldn’t carry on our daily lives without it, yet some still don’t know the rules. Yes, there are rules for email, and we all should learn them. These ten rules will ensure that your email communications are professional and safe for all audiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be professional in all business communications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be polite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that email communications are court-admissible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email can be forwarded and blind copied to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarcasm and colloquialisms don’t translate well electronically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful about opening attachments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email is a popular scam tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Email can be spoofed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not Reply All.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check your spelling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining a professional “tone” in business communications is an essential practice. Get to the point of your conversation early, don’t ramble, and end the email with a professional signoff. Keep your email signatures professional too. Include your name, phone, company name, department, and title. Quotations and witty signoffs are generally unnecessary and often looked at as unprofessional. It is appropriate to include your gender pronouns in your signatures, such as He/Him, She/Her, or They/Them, and please be respectful of other people’s gender pronouns in your communications.</p>
<p>A recipient may print, forward, or blind copy your message, and you have no control over what happens after it leaves your computer. Emails are court-admissible and may be used as evidence to incriminate and show a pattern of behavior. Sarcasm, jokes, and colloquialisms don’t always have the same effect in email as in spoken conversation because the recipient can’t read facial expressions or hear voice inflections that clue them into alternative meanings. You should avoid colloquialisms when using email to communicate with anyone from a different culture. The possibility of insult or misunderstanding is too great.</p>
<p>Being a system administrator or IT professional, you know (or should know) that email is a popular medium for phishing and scams. No, you haven’t won a <span class="keep-together">contest/lottery/raffle</span> that you never entered. No one will deposit any money into your account to help them launder money from another country. Delete these attempts when they pass through your spam filters. Don’t forward them to anyone. Ransomware, Trojan horse malware, and viruses are too common and costly to take any chances. Email can be spoofed. An email can look as if it came from a legitimate sender but turn out to be deceptive and is often dangerous to open.</p>
<p>Please check your spelling in email communications. Emails, especially business emails, look completely unprofessional with misspelled or incorrect words. Written communications are more formal than spoken ones. You should read your messages aloud before sending them to ensure they carry the correct meaning and that no one can <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="changing with the job market" data-startref="ix_careerjobmktcomm" data-tertiary="learning how to communicate" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871541232"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-secondary="learning how to communicate" data-startref="ix_jobmktcomm" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872158800"/>misinterpret your message.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="communication, learning" data-startref="ix_comm" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872157120"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job market, changing with" data-startref="ix_jobmkt" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871350432"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="changing with the job market" data-startref="ix_careerjobmkt" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871349216"/></p>

Not doing so will give you a bad reputation in the business and may limit future opportunities for career moves. You want each position to be a stepping stone for the next. You also want a credible work history. It’s far more impressive to a potential employer that your former manager gives you a recommendation as compared to one from a former colleague. Accolades from former customers are also highly regarded if you feel comfortable soliciting them. In the following sections, I cover your resignation letter, your post-resignation behavior, and how to handle coworkers, managers, and customers after your announcement.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Writing the Resignation Letter" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="writing_the_resignation_letter">
<h2>Writing the Resignation Letter</h2>
<p>Writing letters of resignation is often one of the hardest things you’ll do in your career. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="leaving your current position" data-tertiary="writing the resignation letter" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871386976"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resignation letter, writing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871385696"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leaving your current position" data-secondary="writing the resignation letter" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871384960"/>My emotions have run the gamut when writing resignation letters, and I’ve experienced joy, anger, depression, and fear. It’s often hard to leave a job you love, and it’s also hard to leave one where you’ve gained friends and comfort. You must take extra precautions when resigning from a position you don’t like, and restraint is vital.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Giving notice of your intent to leave" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="giving_notice_of_your_intent_to_leave">
<h3>Giving notice of your intent to leave</h3>
<p>The first item of business in your resignation letter is to state your intention to leave your position. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resignation letter, writing" data-secondary="giving notice of your intent to leave" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871334880"/>Giving your resignation letter to your immediate supervisor or manager is typical. Address them in the letter as you would in a conversation with <em>Dear Ms. Alvarez</em> or <em>Dear Octavia</em>. Don’t use “To Whom It May Concern” or other generic greetings, as it is rude.</p>
<p>Provide the date of your intended last day of work. It’s customary in the United States to give a two-week notice of your intent to leave, although not required.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Describing your goals" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="describing_your_goals">
<h3>Describing your goals</h3>
<p>Don’t complain, deny, degrade, or state negative reasons for leaving. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resignation letter, writing" data-secondary="describing your goals" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871326928"/>Instead, communicate your goals and reasons for going but don’t write “to get a better job” or something similar. State your goals as “I’ve found a position that offers me the growth and opportunity I’m seeking in my career” or “My new position offers me advancement into management.” It’s also appropriate to state something like “I’ve decided to reprioritize my goals, and I’m pursuing a new opportunity that allows me to &lt;state the opportunity&gt;.”</p>
<p>This letter is not the appropriate place to air your grievances. Be professional and concise. You don’t need to write more than one or two sentences that define your goals in seeking a new job.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Offering to help during the transition" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="offering_to_help_during_the_transition">
<h3>Offering to help during the transition</h3>
<p>State in your letter that you are willing and eager to help<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resignation letter, writing" data-secondary="offering to help during transition" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871997360"/> transition your duties and responsibilities to a new person. If you have someone in mind who could take over your role or cross-train with you, state, “I believe Anna is a good choice to transfer my duties to as she and I have worked together, and she has expressed an interest in expanding her role.” Don’t go into lengthy detail. It’s your management’s decision to choose Anna or a different person.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Leaving your options open" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="leaving_your_options_open">
<h3>Leaving your options open</h3>
<p>State that you’re open to discussing your resignation with your manager.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resignation letter, writing" data-secondary="leaving your options open" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871560928"/> This statement leaves the option open with your management that there could be an opportunity for negotiation.</p>
<p>Sometimes a company values your work to the point that they will give you a counteroffer to stay. The decision to keep your job comes with some caveats, but staying is reasonable. A so-called “buy-back” is not uncommon, and any offer should be listened to and seriously considered.</p>
<p>I’ve heard both sides of the argument for staying versus leaving after being given a counteroffer. I don’t have any particular advice on the matter except that if you’re currently unhappy, you’ll probably be unhappy again after you decide to stay. If you’re not unhappy but are genuinely looking for opportunities that your current position doesn’t offer, you now have a chance to discuss and negotiate them.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Delivering the letter" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="delivering_the_letter">
<h3>Delivering the letter</h3>
<p>Delivering your resignation letter isn’t easy, even if you hate your job.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="resignation letter, writing" data-secondary="delivering the letter" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871688944"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="delivering your resignation letter" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871584912"/> It’s stressful and fear-inducing. I always print the letter, put it into an envelope with my manager’s name, and place it on their desk when they’re not in their office. That’s just my nonconfrontational style. I don’t know if it’s correct or incorrect, but that’s how I <span class="keep-together">do it.</span></p>
<p>Your manager has the time to read your letter in private, discuss it with their manager, and craft a response. Often, an in-person resignation leads to spontaneous complaints or worse by both parties. This method obviously won’t work if you’re remote from your management.</p>
</div></section>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Leaving Your Job" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="leaving_your_job">
<h2>Leaving Your Job</h2>
<p>In some cases, your current employer may cut your notification time short. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leaving your current position" data-secondary="leaving the job" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871514144"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="leaving your current position" data-tertiary="leaving the job" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_careerleaveleave"/>Some employers dismiss you after submitting your resignation letter with no discussion, negotiation, or exit interview. You have to prepare yourself for any outcome and response. Leaving a job can be as emotionally challenging as getting laid off or fired, and it’s not easy for your employer or for you. These sections deal with working during your notification period and how to proceed with dignity and respect.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Transitioning your duties" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="transitioning_your_duties">
<h3>Transitioning your duties</h3>
<p>Most of us feel some ownership of our systems, scripts, documentation, and accomplishments during our tenure at a job. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leaving your current position" data-secondary="leaving the job" data-tertiary="transitioning your duties" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871708464"/>It’s normal to feel like you’re letting go of something you own. Remember that you’re taking on new challenges and leaving old ones behind. Transition your duties to your coworkers with kindness and respect. They’re taking on new responsibilities and probably feeling overwhelmed because you’re going, and they won’t have your experience to rely on in a few days.</p>

<h3>Completing unfinished tasks</h3>

Don’t leave a project half done if it’s possible to finish. Your level of motivation will be low but remember that you have a responsibility to your coworkers to make this transition easy and comfortable for them.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Writing documentation" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="writing_documentation">
<h3>Writing documentation</h3>
<p>If you haven’t done so during your tenure at your job, it’s time to document what you do. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="documenting your work" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871302640"/>Document your daily tasks.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leaving your current position" data-secondary="leaving the job" data-tertiary="documenting your work" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871325056"/> Identify quirks, scripts, and anything that might help a new person take over after you leave. Documentation isn’t easy, but you must help your coworkers compensate for your absence. Do the right thing and provide plenty of instruction for them. Even if you hate your current employer, you’ll feel better if you don’t leave them in an unfavorable position. Doing your best at this point will mean that you don’t have to make excuses, feel ashamed, or hide your face at a restaurant should you have a chance meeting with a former employer.</p>

The exit interview is when you can help your former coworkers and clear the air with your employer. Remember to maintain a professional attitude. State facts, not emotional baggage, and then feel satisfied that you’ve told your employer how you think and why you’re leaving.</p>
<p>Sometimes exit interviews have a significant impact on current and future employees. Some employers want to retain good people and attempt to improve a chronic or undesirable situation.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="leaving your current position" data-startref="ix_careerleaveleave" data-tertiary="leaving the job" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871334400"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="leaving your current position" data-startref="ix_leave" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871332368"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-secondary="leaving your current position" data-startref="ix_careerleave" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871291408"/></p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The last thing I want to tell you is when it comes to your career, don’t listen to the naysayers. You will hear that job markets for whatever you’re doing are poor, and you’re in a dead-end career. Linux system administration is a good career choice. There’s growth potential as a system administrator and plenty of jobs available. As more companies move to the cloud, you will have to shift your focus from managing local systems to managing cloud-based ones.</p>
<p>Work on getting your Linux certifications and supplement those with other technology certifications, such as networking and security. No matter where computing goes, security will always be a concern and an opportunity. Good luck to you in your searches and your career.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="career moves" data-startref="ix_career" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871536368"/></p>
