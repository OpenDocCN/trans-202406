- en: Welcome to *Programming Kubernetes*, and thanks for choosing to spend some time
    with us. Before we jump into the deep end, let’s quickly get a few administrative
    and organizational things out of the way. We’ll also share our motivation for
    writing this book.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’re a developer going cloud-native, or an AppOps or namespace admin wanting
    to get the maximum out of Kubernetes. Vanilla settings don’t do it for you anymore,
    and you may have learned about [extension points](http://bit.ly/2XmoeKF). Good.
    You’re in the right place.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both of us have been contributing to, writing about, teaching, and using Kubernetes
    since early 2015\. We have developed tooling and apps for Kubernetes and given
    workshops about developing on and with Kubernetes a couple of times. At some point
    we said, “Why don’t we write a book?” This would allow even more people, asynchronously
    and at their own pace, to learn how to program Kubernetes. And here we are. We
    hope you have as much fun reading the book as we did writing it.

- en: In the grand scheme of things, it’s still early days for the Kubernetes ecosystem.
    While Kubernetes has, as of early 2018, established itself as the industry standard
    for managing containers (and their lifecycles), there is still a need for good
    practices on how to write native applications. The basic building blocks, such
    as [`client-go`](http://bit.ly/2L5cUMu), custom resources, and cloud-native programming
    languages, are in place. However, much of the knowledge is tribal, spread across
    people’s minds and scattered over thousands of Slack channels and StackOverflow
    answers.

- en: At the time of this writing, Kubernetes 1.15 was the latest stable version.
    The compiled examples should work with older versions (down to 1.12), but we are
    basing the code on newer versions of the libraries, corresponding to 1.14\. Some
    of the more advanced CRD features require 1.13 or 1.14 clusters to run, CRD conversion
    in chapter 9 even 1.15\. If you don’t have access to a recent enough cluster,
    using [Minikube](http://bit.ly/2WT3k1l) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) on
    the local workstation is highly recommended.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tools in this book often have multiple dependencies that you’ll need to
    meet by installing some packages. Knowledge of the package management system on
    your machine is therefore required. It could be *apt* on Ubuntu/Debian systems,
    *yum* on CentOS/RHEL systems, or *port* or *brew* on macOS. Whatever it is, make
    sure that you know how to install, upgrade, and remove packages.

    *[Version Control with Git](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022862.do )*
    by Jon Loeliger and Matthew McCullough (O’Reilly) is a good place to start. Together
    with Git, the [GitHub website](http://github.com) is a great resource for getting
    started with a hosted repository of your own. To learn about GitHub, check out

    Go has emerged as the new programming language of choice in many startups and
    for many systems-related open source projects. This book is not about teaching
    you Go, but it shows you how to program Kubernetes using Go. You can learn Go
    through a variety of different resources, from online documentation on the [Go
    website](https://golang.org/doc) to blog posts, talks, and a number of books.
