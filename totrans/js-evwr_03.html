you’ve decided to order a sandwich. The server writes&#13;
your order on a slip of paper and passes that paper to the cook. The&#13;
cook reads the order, takes individual ingredients to build the&#13;
sandwich, and passes the sandwich to the server. The server then brings&#13;
the sandwich to you to eat. If you would then like some dessert,&#13;
the process repeats.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>An application programming interface (API) is a set of specifications&#13;
that allows one computer program to interact with another. A web API&#13;
works in much the same way as ordering a sandwich. A client&#13;
requests some data, that data travels to a web server application over&#13;
the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the web server application takes&#13;
the requests and processes the data, and the data is then sent to the client over HTTP.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this chapter we’ll explore the broad topic of web APIs and get started with our development by cloning the starter API project to our local machine. Before we do that, however, let’s explore the requirements of the application that we’ll be building.</p>&#13;

<h1>What We’re Building</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout the book we’ll be building a social note application called&#13;
Notedly. Users will be able to create an account, write notes in&#13;
plain text or Markdown, edit their notes, view a feed of other users’ notes, and&#13;
“favorite” the notes of other users. In this portion of the book, we’ll&#13;
be developing the API to support this application.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In our API:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Users will be able to create notes, as well as read, update, and delete the notes they’ve created.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Users will be able to view a feed of notes created by other&#13;
users, and read individual notes created by others, though they will not&#13;
be able to update or delete them.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Users will be able to create an account, log in, and log out.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Users will be able to retrieve their profile information as well as the public profile information of other users.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Users will be able to favorite the notes of other users as well as&#13;
retrieve a list of their favorites.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h1>Markdown</h1>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Markdown" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513082296"/>Markdown is a popular text markup language that is common in the programming community as well as in text applications such as iA Writer, Ulysses, Byword, and many more. To learn more about Markdown, take a look at the <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org">Markdown Guide website</a>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Though this sounds like a lot, I’ll be breaking it down into small&#13;
chunks throughout this portion of the book. Once you’ve learned to&#13;
perform these types of interactions, you’ll be able to apply them to&#13;
building all sorts of APIs.<a data-startref="ix_ch02-asciidoc1" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513079928"/></p>&#13;

<p><a data-primary="application programming interface (API)" data-secondary="GraphQL for" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513078184"/><a data-primary="GraphQL" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513077336"/>To build our API we’ll be using the <a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL API query language</a>. GraphQL is an open source specification, first developed&#13;
at Facebook in 2012. The advantage of GraphQL is that it allows the&#13;
client to request precisely the data it needs, dramatically simplifying&#13;
and limiting the number of requests. This also provides a distinct&#13;
performance advantage when we’re sending data to mobile clients, as we only&#13;
need to send the data that the client needs. We’ll be exploring how to&#13;
write, develop, and consume GraphQL APIs throughout much of the book.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h1>What about REST?</h1>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Representational State Transfer (REST)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513074072"/><a data-primary="REST (Representational State Transfer)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513073352"/>If you’re familiar with Web API&#13;
terminology, you’ve likely heard of REST (Representational State&#13;
Transfer) APIs. The REST architecture has been (and continues to be) the&#13;
dominant format for APIs. These APIs differ from GraphQL by&#13;
relying upon the URL structure and query parameters to make requests to&#13;
a server. While REST remains relevant, the simplicity of GraphQL, the&#13;
robustness of tooling around GraphQL, and the potential performance&#13;
gains of sending limited data over the wire make GraphQL my preference&#13;
for modern platforms.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Getting Started" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45339513071592">&#13;
<h1>Getting Started</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="application programming interface (API)" data-secondary="getting started with" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513070088"/>Before we can start development, we need to make a copy of the&#13;
project starter files to our machine. The project’s <a href="https://oreil.ly/mYKmE">source code</a> contains all of the scripts and references to third-party libraries that we will need to develop our application. To clone the code to your local machine, open the terminal, navigate to the directory where you keep your projects, <strong><code>git clone</code></strong> the project repository, and install the dependencies with <strong><code>npm install</code></strong>. It may also be helpful to create a <em>notedly</em> directory to keep all of the book’s code organized:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting"><code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd </code>Projects&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code>mkdir notedly <code class="o">&amp;&amp;</code> <code class="nb">cd </code>notedly&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code>git clone git@github.com:javascripteverywhere/api.git&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd </code>api&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code>npm install</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h1>Installing Third-Party Dependencies</h1>&#13;
<p>By making a copy of the book’s starter code and running <code>npm install</code> in the directory, you avoid having to run <code>npm install</code> again for any of the individual third-party dependencies.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The code is structured as follows:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>/src</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This is the directory where you should perform your&#13;
development as you follow along with the book.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>/solutions</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This directory contains the solutions for each chapter.&#13;
If you get stuck, these are available for you to consult.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>/final</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>This directory contains the final working project.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now that you have the code on your local machine, you’ll need to make a&#13;
copy of the project’s <em>.env</em> file. This file is a place to keep environment-specific information or project secrets, such as the database URL, client IDs, and passwords. Because of this you never want to check it into source control. You’ll need your own copy of the <em>.env</em> file. To do this, type the following&#13;
into your terminal, from the <em>api</em> directory:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="js" data-type="programlisting"><code class="nx">cp</code> <code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">env</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">example</code> <code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">env</code></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You should now see an <em>.env</em> file in the directory. You don’t yet need to&#13;
do anything with this file, but we’ll be adding information to it as we&#13;
progress through the development of our API backend. The <em>.gitignore</em>&#13;
file included with the project will ensure that you do not inadvertently&#13;
commit your <em>.env</em> file.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="caution"><h1>Help, I Don’t See the .env File!</h1>&#13;
<p>By default, operating systems hide files that start with a period, as these are typically used by the system, not end users. If you don’t see the <em>.env</em> file, try opening the directory in your text editor. The file should be visible in the file explorer of your editor. Alternately, typing <code>ls -a</code> into your terminal window will list the files in the current working directory.</p>&#13;

<h1>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>APIs provide an interface for data to flow from a database to applications. In doing so, they are the backbone of modern applications. By using GraphQL we can quickly develop modern, scalable API-based applications. In the next chapter we’ll begin our API development by building a web server, using Node.js and Express.<a data-startref="ix_ch02-asciidoc0" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339511366936"/></p>&#13;
