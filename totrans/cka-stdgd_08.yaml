    Kubernetes Administrator certification. I condensed the most relevant information
    in this book for you to succeed. Your journey does not end here. In fact, it’s
    only the beginning as there’s so much more learn in the realm of Kubernetes. I
    would encourage you to dive deeper into the topics discussed in this book and
    branch out even further into the Kubernetes tooling ecosystem.

    exam. The key for scoring as many points as possible is to practice, practice,
    practice. Run through the sample exercises in this book, tap into free and commercial
    practice exams, and even come up with your own practice scenarios to learn the
    ins and outs of Kubernetes and `kubectl`. To solidify your exposure to Kubernetes,
    read the Kubernetes documentation from start to end at least once. In the course
    of this book, we’ve seen that the exam is about more than just testing your knowledge
    of `kubectl`. You’ll also need to be comfortable with other tools like vim, bash,
    and YAML.
