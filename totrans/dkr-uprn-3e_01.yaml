- en: This book is designed for anyone who needs a practical understanding of Linux
    containers and how they can be used to improve development and production practices.
    Most modern integration workflows and production systems require developers and
    operations engineers to have a firm understanding of Linux containers and how
    they can be leveraged to significantly improve repeatability and predictability
    across the system. Along the way we’ll explore how to build, test, deploy, and
    debug Linux containers within the Docker ecosystem. We’ll also cover a few of
    the significant orchestration tools that leverage Linux containers. And finally,
    we’ll round all of that out with some guidance on security and best practices
    for your container environment.

    problems involved in developing and deploying software to production at scale.
    If you’re interested in Linux containers, Docker, Kubernetes, DevOps, and large,
    scalable, software infrastructures, then this book is for you.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today there are many conversations, projects, and articles on the internet about
    Docker, and some of them have even started predicting the demise of Docker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why should you devote precious hours to reading this book?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although there are other alternatives today, Docker single-handedly made Linux
    containers accessible to all engineers. Before Docker created the container image
    format and helped build many of the core libraries used in containerization systems
    today, Linux containers were very difficult to use and primarily remained the
    tools of very large cloud-hosting companies that needed to provide scalability
    while also protecting their systems from untrusted user code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Docker changed all of that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though there is a lot of information about Docker and Linux containers
    out there, the landscape is still actively evolving, and best practices are shifting.
    Imagine that you just read a blog post, published four years ago, about Docker.
    It might still work, but it might not be the best approach anymore. During the
    time it took us to write the first edition of this book, Docker, Inc., released
    four versions of Docker plus a few major tools into their ecosystem. In the seven
    years between the first and third editions of this book, the landscape has changed
    significantly. Docker has stabilized, and there are now many additional tools
    that fill similar roles. Instead of suffering from a complete lack of tools, there
    are now many robust choices for almost every aspect of the DevOps workflow. Wrapping
    your arms around the scope of what Linux containers and Docker provide, understanding
    how they fit into your workflow, and getting all the various integrations right
    are not trivial tasks.

- en: We have worked with multiple companies for over nine years building and operating
    a mix of production Linux container platforms, including Docker, Mesos, and Kubernetes.
    We originally implemented Docker in production only months after its release and
    can share with you some of the experience we gained from evolving our production
    platforms since then. Our goal with this book is for you to benefit from this
    experience by avoiding many of the bumps in the road that we suffered through.
    Even though the [online documentation for the Docker project](https://docs.docker.com)
    is very useful, we will attempt to give you a much bigger picture and expose you
    to many of the best practices that we have learned along the way.

    what Linux containers are, what Docker provides, why they are important, and how
    you can leverage them to streamline everything from local development through
    production. It should be a fascinating trip through a few interesting technologies
    that have some very practical applications.
