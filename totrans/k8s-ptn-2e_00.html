<h1>Foreword</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>When Craig, Joe, and I started Kubernetes nearly eight years ago, I think we all recognized its power to transform the way the world developed and delivered software. I don’t think we knew, or even hoped to believe, how quickly this transformation would come. Kubernetes is now the foundation for the development of portable, reliable systems spanning the major public clouds, private clouds, and bare-metal environments. However, even as Kubernetes has become ubiquitous to the point where you can spin up a cluster in the cloud in less than five minutes, it is still far less obvious to determine where to go once you have created that cluster. It is fantastic that we have seen such significant strides forward in the operationalization of Kubernetes itself, but it is only a part of the solution. It is the foundation on which applications will be built, and it provides a large library of APIs and tools for building these applications, but it does little to provide the application architect or developer with any hints or guidance for how these various pieces can be combined into a complete, reliable system that satisfies their business needs and goals.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Although the necessary perspective and experience for what to do with your Kubernetes cluster can be achieved through past experience with similar systems, or via trial and error, this is expensive both in terms of time and the quality of systems delivered to our end users. When you are starting to deliver mission-critical services on top of a system like Kubernetes, learning your way via trial and error simply takes too much time and results in very real problems of downtime and disruption.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This then is why Bilgin and Roland’s book is so valuable. <em>Kubernetes Patterns</em> enables you to learn from the previous experience that we have encoded into the APIs and tools that make up Kubernetes. Kubernetes is the by-product of the community’s experience building and delivering many different, reliable distributed systems in a variety of different environments. Each object and capability added to Kubernetes represents a foundational tool that has been designed and purpose-built to solve a specific need for the software designer. This book explains how the concepts in Kubernetes solve real-world problems and how to adapt and use these concepts to build the system that you are working on today.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In developing Kubernetes, we always said that our North Star was making the development of distributed systems a CS 101 exercise. If we have managed to achieve that goal successfully, it is books like this one that are the textbooks for such a class. Bilgin and Roland have captured the essential tools of the Kubernetes developer and distilled them into segments that are easy to approach and consume. As you finish this book, you will become aware not just of the components available &#13;
<span class="keep-together">to you</span> in Kubernetes but also the “why” and “how” of building systems with those &#13;
<span class="keep-together">components.</span></p>&#13;
