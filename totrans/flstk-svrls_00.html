<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>When I first learned how to code I had no idea how broad of a spectrum software development was. All I wanted to do was to build an app. Oh boy, I learned how naive I was at that time once I started digging into and piecing together all of the things that it took to accomplish what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>One of the main things I learned was that applications typically consisted of two main parts: frontend (or client-side code) and backend APIs and services. At the time, cloud technologies were in their infancy and learning how to build full stack applications was overwhelming to say the least! This was made even harder because I wanted to build native mobile apps, and I learned that building mobile apps was much tougher to get started with than building web applications.</p>

<p>Fast-forward almost 10 years and the landscape is starting to look much different. Things that once took a large team of developers to do can now sometimes be accomplished by a single developer. Tools like React Native, Flutter, and Cordova allow developers to build and ship cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase. Cloud technologies like AWS Amplify, Firebase, and others allow the same developers to also leverage the cloud to build out the backends much more rapidly than ever before.</p>

<p>I think we are coming into a new paradigm where it is easier than ever to become a full stack developer and the definition of what a full stack developer <em>is</em> is starting to change. I wrote this book to lay out my vision of what this new paradigm looks like in practice and to showcase a technology that has been created specifically to take advantage of the most cutting-edge frontend and cloud technologies. What I am describing in this book is, in my opinion, the future of software engineering.</p>

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p>This book is for any software engineer looking to build full stack applications, especially those interested in cloud computing. It is also aimed at frontend developers looking to learn how to use their existing skill set to build full stack applications using cloud technologies.</p>

<p>It is also a good resource for CTOs and startup founders looking to maximize efficiency and move with the most developer velocity possible while using the fewest resources. The techniques outlined in this book are ideal for rapid prototyping and fast experimentation, allowing developers and founders to get their idea to market quickly and have a product that is also scalable and durable should it succeed.</p>

<h1>How This Book Is Organized</h1>

<p>The goal of this book is to introduce you to all of the pieces needed to build a real-world and scalable full stack application using React and serverless technologies. It gradually introduces features (like authentication, APIs, and databases) and some techniques to implement these features, both on the frontend and backend, by building out different applications in each chapter.</p>

<p>Each application you create will build upon knowledge learned in the previous chapter. In the last chapter, you will build out a sophisticated application utilizing many of the cloud services needed to build real-world applications in your job or startup. When you have finished working through this book, you should have the knowledge and understanding needed to apply what you have learned to build serverless applications on your own using React and AWS cloud technologies.</p>

<dd>
<p>In this chapter, I’ll describe serverless philosophy, the characteristics and benefits of serverless applications, and introduce you to AWS and AWS Amplify CLI.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started with AWS Amplify</em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this chapter, we will get going using AWS Amplify to create and deploy a serverless function. We’ll create the function, then add the API and interact with it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3, <em>Creating Your First App</em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Here, we’ll cover the basic process of creating a new full stack application from scratch by building a notes app. We will create a new React application, initialize a new Amplify project, add a GraphQL API, and then connect to and interact with the API from the client (React) application.</p>
</dd>

<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.xhtml#ch4">Chapter 4, <em>Introduction to Authentication</em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this chapter, we will walk through the process of adding authentication to an application. We will start by creating a new React application and adding basic authentication using the <code>withAuthenticator</code> higher-order component (HOC) from the AWS Amplify React library. We’ll read the user’s metadata and create a profile screen that will allow the user to see their information.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5, <em>Custom Authentication Strategies</em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll look closer at authentication by creating a custom authentication flow with React, React Router, and AWS Amplify. The app will have a sign-up screen, a sign-in screen, and a forgotten-password screen. Once logged in, there will be a main menu that will allow them to navigate to their profile page, a map page, and a welcome screen that will serve as the main view of the app.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6, <em>Serverless Functions In-Depth: Part 1</em></a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.xhtml#ch7">Chapter 7, <em>Serverless Functions In-Depth: Part 2</em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Here, we’ll introduce serverless functions and how to interact with them in a React application. We’ll walk through how to create, update, and delete serverless functions by creating an app that fetches shiba inu pictures from a CORS-protected API with our code living in an AWS Lambda function that we will create and configure using the AWS Amplify CLI.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.xhtml#ch8">Chapter 8, <em>AWS AppSync In-Depth</em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll build upon what we learned in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a> by building a more complex API that includes many-to-many relationships and multiple authorization types. We’ll build an event application that allows admins to create stages and performances. We’ll enable all users to be able to read event information regardless whether they are signed in, but we’ll only allow admin users who are signed in to create, update, or delete events and stages.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9, <em>Building Offline Apps with <span class="keep-together">Amplify DataStore</span></em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover how to add offline functionality using Amplify <span class="keep-together">DataStore.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10, <em>Working with Images and Storage</em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Here, we’ll learn how to create a photo-sharing app that will allow users to upload and view images.</p>
</dd>
<dt><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11, <em>Hosting: Deploying Your Application to <span class="keep-together">the Amplify Console with CI and CD</span></em></a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this final chapter, we’ll take the photo-sharing app we created in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a> and deploy it to a live domain using the Amplify Console. We’ll learn how to add continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) by kicking off new builds when updates are merged to the master branch. Finally, we’ll learn how to add a custom domain so your app will be live on a real URL that you own.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="idm45364356544984">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>Thank you to my wife, Lilly, who has steadfastly supported me through my career and has gone above and beyond to keep our life in order as I worked late nights in the office and sometimes at home to write this book.</p>

<p>Thank you to my kids, Victor and Eli, who are awesome and my inspiration; I love you both very much. And thank you to my parents for putting me in a position to be able to learn things and get second, third, and fourth chances at life.</p>

<p>My thanks go to many groups and individuals: to the the entire AWS Mobile team who took a chance on hiring me fresh out of a tumultuous consulting career to join their team, and gave me the opportunity to work with the smartest people I’ve ever met. To Michael Paris, Mohit Srivastava, Dennis Hills, Adrian Hall, Richard Threlkald, Michael Labieniec, Rohan Deshpande, Amit Patel, and all of my other teammates who have showed me the ropes and helped me learn everything I needed to learn to get going at my new job. To Russ Davis, Lee Johnson, and SchoolStatus for giving the opportunity to learn bleeding-edge technology on the job that ultimately catapulted my career into consulting. To Brian Noah, Nate Lubeck, and my team at Egood, the first “real” tech job I had, for exposing me to the world of meetups and conferences as well as what it takes to be a great developer.</p>
