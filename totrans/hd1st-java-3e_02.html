<p>Your brain craves novelty. It’s always searching, scanning, <em>waiting</em> for something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive.</p>
<p>Today, you’re less likely to be a tiger snack. But your brain’s still looking. You just never know.</p>
<p>So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things you encounter? Everything it <em>can</em> to stop them from interfering with the brain’s <em>real</em> job—recording things that <em>matter</em>. It doesn’t bother saving the boring things; they never make it past the “this is obviously not important” filter.</p>
<p>How does your brain <em>know</em> what’s important? Suppose you’re out for a day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens inside your head?</p>
<p>Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. <em>Chemicals surge</em> .</p>
<p>And that’s how your brain knows...</p>
<p><strong>This must be important! Don’t forget it!</strong></p>
<p>But imagine you’re at home, or in a library. It’s a safe, warm, tiger-free zone. You’re studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn some tough technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, ten days at the most.</p>
<p>Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s trying to make sure that this <em>obviously</em> non-important content doesn’t clutter up scarce resources. Resources that are better spent storing the really <em>big</em> things. Like tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like how you should never again snowboard in shorts.</p>
<p>And there’s no simple way to tell your brain, “Hey, brain, thank you very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how little I’m registering on the emotional richter scale right now, I really <em>do</em> want you to keep this stuff around.”</p>

<h5>We think of a Head First Java reader as a <u>learner.</u></h5>

<p>So what does it take to <em>learn</em> something? First, you have to <em>get</em> it, then make sure you don’t <em>forget</em> it. It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, <em>learning</em> takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Head First learning principles:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make it visual.</strong> Images are far more memorable than words alone, and make learning much more effective (up to 89% improvement in recall and transfer studies). It also makes things more understandable. <strong>Put the words within or near the graphics</strong> they relate to, rather than on the bottom or on another page, and learners will be up to <em>twice</em> as likely to solve problems related to the content.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f0xxvifig02.png" alt="Images" width="470" height="761"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p><strong>Use a conversational and personalized style</strong>. In recent studies, students performed up to 40% better on post-learning tests if the content spoke directly to the reader, using a first-person, conversational style rather than taking a formal tone. Tell stories instead of lecturing. Use casual language. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Which would <em>you</em> pay more attention to: a stimulating dinner party companion, or a lecture?</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f0xxvifig03.png" alt="Images" width="577" height="394"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p><strong>Get the learner to think more deeply.</strong> In other words, unless you actively flex your neurons, nothing much happens in your head. A reader has to be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to solve problems, draw conclusions, and generate new knowledge. And for that, you need challenges, exercises, thought-provoking questions, and activities that involve both sides of the brain and multiple senses.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f0xxvifig04.png" alt="Images" width="473" height="583"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p><strong>Get—and keep—the reader’s attention.</strong> We’ve all had the “I really want to learn this but I can’t stay awake past page one” experience. Your brain pays attention to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, strange, eye-catching, unexpected. Learning a new, tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be boring. Your brain will learn much more quickly if it’s not.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f0xxvifig05.png" alt="Images" width="171" height="213"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p><strong>Touch their emotions.</strong> We now know that your ability to remember something is largely dependent on its emotional content. You remember what you care about. You remember when you feel something. No we’re not talking heart-wrenching stories about a boy and his dog. We’re talking emotions like surprise, curiosity, fun, “what the...?” , and the feeling of “I Rule!” that comes when you solve a puzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is hard, or realize you know something that “I’m more technical than thou” Bob from engineering <em>doesn’t</em>.</p>

<h1>Metacognition: thinking about thinking</h1>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f000xxvii-01.png" alt="Images" width="420" height="543"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you learn.</p>
<p>Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were growing up. We were <em>expected</em> to learn, but rarely <em>taught</em> to learn.</p>
<p>But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you want to learn Java. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time.</p>
<p>To get the most from this book, or <em>any</em> book or learning experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on <em>that</em> content.</p>
<p>The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing its best to keep the new content from sticking.</p>
<p><strong>So just how <em>DO</em> you get your brain to treat Java like it was a hungry tiger?</strong></p>
<p>There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you <em>are</em> able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics, if you keep pounding on the same thing. With enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t <em>feel</em> important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing <em>over</em> and <em>over</em> and <em>over</em> , so I suppose it must be.”</p>
<p>The faster way is to do <strong><em>anything that increases brain activity,</em></strong> especially different <em>types</em> of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words <em>within</em> the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to <em>get</em> that this is something worth paying attention to, and possibly recording.</p>
<p>A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily <em>care</em> that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.</p>
<p>But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Here’s what WE did:"><div class="sect1" id="hereapostrophes_what_we_did">
<h1>Here’s what WE did:</h1>
<p>We used <strong><em>pictures</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s concerned, a picture really <em>is</em> worth 1024 words. And when text and pictures work together, we embedded the text <em>in</em> the pictures because your brain works more effectively when the text is <em>within</em> the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the text somewhere.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f000xxviii-01.png" alt="Images" width="165" height="147"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>We used <strong><em>repetition</em></strong>, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media types, and <em>multiple senses</em> , to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area of your brain.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f000xxviii-02.png" alt="Images" width="232" height="177"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>We used concepts and pictures in <strong><em>unexpected</em></strong> ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, and we used pictures and ideas with at least <em>some</em> <strong><em>emotional</em> <em>content</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes you to <em>feel</em> something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is nothing more than a little <strong><em>humor</em></strong>, <strong><em>surprise</em></strong>, or <strong><em>interest.</em></strong></p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f000xxviii-03.png" alt="Images" width="169" height="126"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>We used a personalized, <strong><em>conversational style</em></strong>, because your brain is tuned to pay more attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively listening to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re <em>reading</em> .</p>
<p>We included more than 50 <strong><em>exercises</em></strong> because your brain is tuned to learn and remember more when you <strong><em>do</em></strong> things than when you <em>read</em> about things. And we made the exercises challenging-yet-do-able, because that’s what most <em>people</em> prefer.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f000xxviii-04.png" alt="Images" width="144" height="17"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>We used <strong><em>multiple learning styles</em></strong>, because <em>you</em> might prefer step-by-step procedures, while someone else wants to understand the big picture first, while someone else just wants to see a code example. But regardless of your own learning preference, <em>everyone</em> benefits from seeing the same content represented in multiple ways.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f000xxviii-06.png" alt="Images" width="223" height="67"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>We include content for <strong><em>both sides of your brain</em></strong>, because the more of your brain you engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>And we included <strong><em>stories</em></strong> and exercises that present <strong><em>more than one point of view,</em></strong> because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make evaluations and judgments.</p>
<p>We included <strong><em>challenges</em></strong>, with exercises, and by asking <strong><em>questions</em></strong> that don’t always have a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to <em>work</em> at something (just as you can’t get your <em>body</em> in shape by watching people at the gym). But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the <em>right</em> things. That <strong><em>you’re not spending one extra dendrite</em></strong> processing a hard-to-understand example, or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or extremely terse text.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f000xxviii-07.png" alt="Images" width="176" height="147"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>We used an <strong><em>80/20</em></strong> approach. We assume that if you’re going for a PhD in Java, this won’t be your only book. So we don’t talk about <em>everything</em> . Just the stuff you’ll actually <em>use</em> .</p>

<p>So, we did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a starting point; Listen to your brain and figure out what works for you and what doesn’t. Try new things.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#9D9EA0;">Cut this out and stick it on your refrigerator.</span></p>
</div>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/1.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="21"/></span> <strong>Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize.</strong></p>
<p>Don’t just <em>read</em>. Stop and think. When the book asks you a question, don’t just skip to the answer. Imagine that someone really <em>is</em> asking the question. The more deeply you force your brain to think, the better chance you have of learning and remembering.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/2.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="21"/></span> <strong>Do the exercises. Write your own notes.</strong></p>
<p>We put them in, but if we did them for you, that would be like having someone else do your workouts for you. And don’t just <em>look</em> at the exercises. <strong>Use a pencil.</strong> There’s plenty of evidence that physical activity while learning can increase the learning.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/3.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="21"/></span> <strong>Read the “There are No Dumb Questions”</strong></p>
<p>That means all of them. They’re not optional sidebars—they’re part of the core content! Sometimes the questions are more useful than the answers.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/4.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="20"/></span> <strong>Don’t do all your reading in one place.</strong></p>
<p>Stand up, stretch, move around, change chairs, change rooms. It’ll help your brain <em>feel</em> something, and it keeps your learning from being too connected to a particular place.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/5.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="20"/></span> <strong>Make this the last thing you read before bed. Or at least the last <em>challenging</em> thing.</strong></p>
<p>Part of the learning (especially the transfer to long-term memory) happens after you put the book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to do more processing. If you put in something new during that processing time, some of what you just learned will be lost.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/6.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="20"/></span> <strong>Drink water. Lots of it.</strong></p>
<p>Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. Dehydration (which can happen before you ever feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/7.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="19"/></span> <strong>Talk about it. Out loud.</strong></p>
<p>Speaking activates a different part of the brain. If you’re trying to understand something or increase your chance of remembering it later, say it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud to someone else. You’ll learn more quickly, and you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were there when you were reading about it.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/8.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="19"/></span> <strong>Listen to your brain.</strong></p>
<p>Pay attention to whether your brain is getting overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you might even hurt the process.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/9.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="19"/></span> <strong>Feel something!</strong></p>
<p>Your brain needs to know that this <em>matters</em>. Get involved with the stories. Make up your own captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is <em>still</em> better than feeling nothing at all.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="inlineimage"><img src="Images/10.png" alt="Images" width="20" height="20"/></span> <strong>Type and run the code.</strong></p>
<p>Type and run the code examples. Then you can experiment with changing and improving the code (or breaking it, which is sometimes the best way to figure out what’s really happening). Most of the code, expecially long examples and Ready-Bake Code, are at <em><a href="https://oreil.ly/hfJava_3e_examples">https://oreil.ly/hfJava_3e_examples</a></em>.</p></li>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Java" data-secondary="setting up" id="idm46038398237248"/>You do <em>not</em> need any other development tool, such as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

<h5>Setting Up Java</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>Because versions are moving quickly and advice on the right JDK to use may change, we’ve put detailed instructions on how to install Java into the code samples project online:</p>
<p><em><a href="https://oreil.ly/hfJava_install">https://oreil.ly/hfJava_install</a></em></p>
<p>This is a simplified version.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don’t know which version of Java to download, we recommend using Java 17.</p></li>
<li><p>There are many free builds of OpenJDK available (the open source version of Java). We suggest the community-supported Eclipse Adoptium JDK at <em><a href="https://adoptium.net">https://adoptium.net</a></em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The JDK includes everything you need to compile and run Java. The JDK does not include the API documentation, and you need that! Download the Java SE API documentation. You can also access the API docs online without downloading them, but trust us, it’s worth the download.</p></li>
<li><p>You need a text editor. Virtually any text editor will do (vi, emacs), including the GUI ones that come with most operating systems. Notepad, Wordpad, TextEdit, etc., all work, as long as you’re using plain text (not rich text) and make sure they don’t append a “.txt” on to the end of your source code (“.java”) file.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you’ve downloaded and unpacked/installed/whatever (depends on which version and for which OS), you need to add an entry to your PATH environment variable that points to the <em>bin</em> directory inside the main Java directory. The <em>bin</em> directory is the one you need a PATH to, so that when you type:</p>
<p><code>% javac</code></p>
<p>at the command line, your terminal will know how to find the javac compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: if you have trouble with your installation, we recommend you go to <a href="http://javaranch.com">javaranch.com</a> and join the Java-Beginning forum! Actually, you should do that whether you have trouble or not.</p></li>

<p>This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately stripped out everything that might get in the way of <em>learning</em> whatever it is we’re working on at that point in the book. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.</p>

<p><strong>We use simple UML-<em>like</em> diagrams.</strong></p>
<p>If we’d used <em>pure</em> UML, you’d be seeing something that <em>looks</em> like Java, but with syntax that’s just plain <em>wrong</em>. So we use a simplified version of UML that doesn’t conflict with Java syntax. If you don’t already know UML, you won’t have to worry about learning Java <em>and</em> UML at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>We don’t worry about organizing and packaging your own code.</strong></p>
<p>In this book, you can get on with the business of learning Java, without stressing over some of the organizational or administrative details of developing Java programs. You <em>will</em> , in the real world, need to know—and use—these details, but since building and deploying Java applications generally relies on third-party build tools like Maven and Gradle, we have assumed you’ll learn those tools separately.</p>

<p><strong>The end-of-chapter <span style="color:#646466;"><strong>exercises</strong></span> are mandatory; <span style="color:#646466;"><strong>puzzles</strong></span> are optional. Answers for both are at the end of each chapter.</strong></p>
<p>One thing you need to know about the puzzles—<em>they’re puzzles</em>. As in logic puzzles, brain teasers, crossword puzzles, etc. The <em>exercises</em> are here to help you practice what you’ve learned, and you should do them all. The puzzles are a different story, and some of them are quite challenging in a <em>puzzle</em> way. These puzzles are meant for <em>puzzlers</em> , and you probably already know if you are one. If you’re not sure, we suggest you give some of them a try, but whatever happens, don’t be discouraged if you <em>can’t</em> solve a puzzle or if you simply can’t be bothered to take the time to work them out.</p>

<p><strong>The “Sharpen Your Pencil” exercises don’t all have answers.</strong></p>
<p>Not printed in the book, anyway. For some of them, there <em>is</em> no right answer, and for the others, part of the learning experience for the Sharpen activities is for <em>you</em> to decide if and when your answers are right.</p>
<p><strong>The code examples are as lean as possible.</strong></p>
<p>It’s frustrating to wade through 200 lines of code looking for the two lines you need to understand. Most examples in this book are shown within the smallest possible context, so that the part you’re trying to learn is clear and simple. So don’t expect the code to be robust, or even complete. That’s <em>your</em> assignment for after you finish the book. The book examples are written specifically for <em>learning</em> and aren’t always fully functional.</p>

<p>Huge thanks to <strong>Zan McQuade</strong> and <strong>Nicole Tach</strong><strong>é</strong> for enabling us to finally get this edition out! Zan, thanks for connecting Trisha back up to the Head First world, and Nicole, fantastic work driving us to get this done. Thanks to <strong>Meghan Blanchette</strong>, who left O’Reilly a hundred years ago, but it was she who introduced Bert and Trisha back in 2014.</p>

<p><strong><em>Trisha would like to thank:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Helen Scott</strong>, for providing frequent feedback on the new topics covered. She consistently stopped me from going too deep or assuming too much knowledge, and is a true champion of the learner. I can’t wait to start working even more closely with her on our next project.</p>
<p>My team at JetBrains for their patience and encouragement: <strong>Dalia Abo Sheasha</strong>, for test-driving the lambdas and streams chapter, and <strong>Mala Gupta</strong>, for giving me exactly the information I needed about modern Java certifications. Extra special thanks to <strong>Hadi Hariri</strong> for all his support, always.</p>
<p>The Friday Pub Lunch <em>informaticos</em> , for tolerating lunchtime conversations on whatever aspect of Java I was trying to explain that day or week, and <strong>Alys</strong>, <strong>Jen</strong>, and <strong>Clare</strong> for helping me to figure out when to prioritize this book over family. Thanks to <strong>Holly Cummins</strong> for finding a last minute bug.</p>
<p><strong>Evie</strong> and <strong>Amy</strong> for the suggestions on how to improve the ice cream examples for Java’s Optional type. Thank you both for being genuinely interested in my progress, and for the spontaneous high-fives when you heard I’d finished.</p>
<p>None of this would have been possible without <strong>Israel Boza Rodriguez</strong>. You put up with me derailing important conversations like “what should we have for dinner?” with questions like “do you think CountDownLatch is too niche to teach beginner developers?” Crucially, you helped me to create space and time to work on the book, and regularly reminded me why I wanted to take on the project in the first place.</p>
<p>Thank you to <strong>Bert</strong> and <strong>Kathy</strong> for bringing me on this journey. It was an honor to learn how to be a Head First author from the horse’s mouth, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bert and Kathy would like to thank:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Beth Robson</strong> and <strong>Eric Freeman</strong>, for their overall, ongoing, badass support of the Head First series. A special thanks to Beth for the many conversations we had discussing what new Java topics to teach and how to teach them.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Wheaton</strong> and the amazing moderators at <a href="http://CodeRanch.com">CodeRanch.com</a> (a.k.a. JavaRanch), for keeping CodeRanch a friendly place for Java beginners. A special thanks to <strong>Campbell Ritchie</strong>, <strong>Jeanne Boyarsky</strong>, <strong>Stephan van Hulst</strong>, <strong>Rob Spoor</strong>, <strong>Tim Cooke</strong>, <strong>Fred Rosenberger</strong>, <strong>and Frits Walraven</strong> for their invaluable input concerning what have been the truly important additions to Java since the 2nd edition.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Gustafson</strong>, for teaching me so much about software development and rock climbing, AND for great discussions concerning the state of programming. <strong>Eric Normand</strong>, for teaching us a little FP, and helping us figure out how to slip a few of the best ideas from FP into an OO book. <strong>Simon Roberts</strong>, for his ongoing and passionate teaching of Java to students all over the world. Thanks to <strong>Heinz Kabutz</strong> and <strong>Venkat Subramaniam</strong> for helping us explore the nooks and crannies of Java Streams.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Baldwin</strong> and <strong>Mike Loukides</strong>, for their tireless support of Head First for all these years. <strong>Ron Bilodeau</strong> and <strong>Kristen Brown</strong>, for their outstanding, always patient and friendly support.</p>

<p><strong>Jess</strong> works at Hewlett-Packard on the Self-Healing Services Team. She has a bachelor’s in computer engineering from Villanova University, has her SCJP 1.4 and SCWCD certifications, and is literally months away from receiving her master’s in software engineering at Drexel University (whew!).</p>
<p>When she’s not working, studying, or motoring in her MINI Cooper S, Jess can be found fighting her cat for yarn as she completes her latest knitting or crochet project (anybody want a hat?). She is originally from Salt Lake City, Utah (no, she’s not Mormon...yes, you were too going to ask) and is currently living near Philadelphia with her husband, Mendra, and two cats: Chai and Sake.</p>

<h1>Other people to credit, for the 2nd Edition</h1>
<p><strong><em>At O’Reilly:</em></strong></p>
<p>Our biggest thanks to <strong>Mike Loukides</strong> at O’Reilly, for taking a chance on this, and helping to shape the Head First concept into a book (and <em>series</em>). As this second edition goes to print there are now five Head First books, and he’s been with us all the way. To <strong>Tim O’Reilly</strong>, for his willingness to launch into something <em>completely</em> new and different. Thanks to the clever <strong>Kyle Hart</strong> for figuring out how Head First fits into the world and for launching the series. Finally, to <strong>Edie Freedman</strong> for designing the Head First “emphasize the <em>head</em> ” cover.</p>

<p><strong><em>Our intrepid beta testers and reviewer team:</em></strong></p>
<p>Our top honors and thanks go to the director of our javaranch tech review team, <strong>Johannes de Jong</strong>. This is your fifth time around with us on a Head First book, and we’re thrilled you’re still speaking to us. <strong>Jeff Cumps</strong> is on his third book with us now and relentless about finding areas where we needed to be more clear or correct.</p>
<p><strong>Corey McGlone</strong>, you rock. And we think you give the clearest explanations on JavaRanch. You’ll probably notice we stole one or two of them. <strong>Jason Menard</strong> saved our technical butts on more than a few details, and <strong>Thomas Paul</strong>, as always, gave us expert feedback and found the subtle Java issues the rest of us missed. <strong>Jane Griscti</strong> has her Java chops (and knows a thing or two about writing), and it was great to have her helping on the new edition along with long-time javarancher <strong>Barry Gaunt</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Marilyn de Queiroz</strong> gave us excellent help on <em>both</em> editions of the book. <strong>Chris Jones</strong>, <strong>John Nyquist</strong>, <strong>James Cubeta</strong>, <strong>Terri Cubeta</strong>, and <strong>Ira Becker</strong> gave us a ton of help on the first edition.</p>
<p>Special thanks to a few of the Head Firsters who’ve been helping us from the beginning: <strong>Angelo Celeste</strong>, <strong>Mikalai Zaikin</strong>, and <strong>Thomas Duff</strong> (<a href="http://twduff.com">twduff.com</a>). And thanks to our terrific agent, <strong>David Rogelberg</strong> of StudioB (but seriously, what about the <em>movie</em> rights?)</p>

<p><strong>Paul Wheaton</strong>, the javaranch Trail Boss for supporting thousands of Java learners. <strong>Solveig Haugland</strong>, mistress of J2EE and author of <em>Dating Design Patterns</em>. Authors <strong>Dori Smith</strong> and <strong>Tom Negrino (<a href="http://backupbrain.com">backupbrain.com</a>)</strong>, for helping us navigate the tech book world.</p>
<p>Our Head First partners in crime, <strong>Eric Freeman and Beth Freeman</strong> (authors of Head First Design Patterns), for giving us the Bawls™ to finish this on time.</p>
<p><strong>Sherry Dorris</strong>, for the things that really matter.</p>
<p><strong><em>Brave early adopters of the Head First series:</em></strong></p>
<p>Joe Litton, Ross P. Goldberg, Dominic Da Silva, honestpuck, Danny Bromberg, Stephen Lepp, Elton Hughes, Eric Christensen, Vulinh Nguyen, Mark Rau, Abdulhaf, Nathan Oliphant, Michael Bradly, Alex Darrow, Michael Fischer, Sarah Nottingham, Tim Allen, Bob Thomas, and Mike Bibby (the first).</p>
<p>*The large number of acknowledgments is because we’re testing the theory that everyone mentioned in a book acknowledgment will buy at least one copy, probably more, what with relatives and everything. If you’d like to be in the acknowledgment of our <em>next</em> book, and you have a large family, write to us.</p>
