- en: Kubernetes, as a runtime and orchestration environment for microservices, is
    widely used among startups and large enterprises alike. As your organization ramps
    up on the number of applications, managing the Kubernetes clusters becomes a full-time
    job. That’s the role of a Kubernetes administrator. The person responsible for
    this job ensures that each cluster is an operational state, scales up the cluster
    by onboarding nodes, upgrades the Kubernetes version of the nodes to incorporate
    patches and new features, and is in charge of a backup strategy for crucial cluster
    data. To help job seekers and employers have a standard means to demonstrate and
    evaluate proficiency in developing with a Kubernetes environment, the Cloud Native
    Computing Foundation (CNCF) developed the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator
    (CKA)](https://oreil.ly/Ds8nq) program. To achieve this certification, you need
    to pass an exam.

- en: There are two other Kubernetes certifications you can find on the CNCF web page.
    The [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)](https://oreil.ly/RxHwQ)
    focuses on the developer-centric application of Kubernetes. The [Certified Kubernetes
    Security Specialist (CKS)](https://oreil.ly/53csH) was created to verify the competence
    on security-based topics and requires a successful pass of the CKA exam before
    you can register. Passing the CKAD and CKS are not mandatory for taking the CKA
    exam.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this study guide, I will explore the topics covered in the CKA exam to fully
    prepare you to pass the certification exam. We’ll look at determining when and
    how you should apply the core concepts of Kubernetes to manage an application.
    We’ll also examine the `kubectl` command-line tool, a mainstay of the Kubernetes
    engineer. I will also offer tips to help you better prepare for the exam and share
    my personal experience with getting ready for all aspects of it.

- en: The CKA is different from the typical multiple-choice format of other certifications.
    It’s completely performance based and requires you to demonstrate deep knowledge
    of the tasks at hand under immense time pressure. Are you ready to pass the test
    on the first go?

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary target group for this book is administrators who want to prepare
    for the CKA exam. The “exam details and resources” content covers all aspects
    of the exam curriculum, though basic knowledge of the Kubernetes architecture
    and its concepts is expected. If you are completely new to Kubernetes, I recommend
    reading [*Kubernetes Up & Running*](https://oreil.ly/KSPkv) by Brendan Burns,
    Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, and Lachlan Evenson (O’Reilly) or *Kubernetes in Action*
    by Marko Lukša (Manning Publications) first.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The content of the book condenses the most important aspects relevant to the
    CKA exam. Cloud-provider-specific Kubernetes implementations like AKS or GKE do
    not need to be considered. Given the plethora of configuration options available
    in Kubernetes, it’s almost impossible to cover all use cases and scenarios without
    duplicating the official documentation. Test takers are encouraged to reference
    the [Kubernetes documentation](https://oreil.ly/MoLjc) as the go-to compendium
    for broader exposure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outline of the book follows the CKA curriculum to a T. While there might
    be a more natural, didactical structure for learning Kubernetes in general, the
    curriculum outline will help test takers prepare for the exam by focusing on specific
    topics. As a result, you will find yourself cross-referencing other chapters of
    the book depending on your existing knowledge level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be aware that this book covers only the concepts relevant to the CKA exam. Certain
    primitives that you may expect to be covered by the certification curriculum—for
    example, the API primitive Ingress—are not discussed. Refer to the Kubernetes
    documentation or other books if you want to dive deeper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practical experience with Kubernetes is key to passing the exam. Each chapter
    contains a section named “Sample Exercises” with practice questions. Solutions
    to those questions can be found in the [Appendix](app01.xhtml#appendix-a).
