    school or college, stayed with it for thirty or more years, and then retired,
    but that just isn’t the way careers go these days. And by *these days*, I mean
    for the past thirty years. In the various technology-related careers, it’s rare
    to find anyone in the same position with the same company for over five years.

    several positions within each company during that time. Most of my jobs lasted
    from eighteen months to two-and-a-half years. It was prudent to switch roles often,
    although all were lateral moves, and I grew and learned in each one. I worked
    for the same manager three or more times during my tenure at EDS and HP. We both
    moved around inside the company and kept crossing paths. It seemed that managers
    moved around as often as regular employees. In those days of massive and continuous
    layoffs, it was wise to be a moving target.

    some managers and companies view a technical person who doesn’t make a move every
    eighteen to twenty-four months as less desirable as a potential candidate. I’m
    unconvinced that this is true. There’s something to be said for someone stable
    enough to stay put for a few years and become competent in every aspect of their
    job. But you will, at some point, find yourself looking for a new job in system
    administration. This chapter explores the various ways to find employment, upgrade
    your job, and go after those highly desirable “dream” positions.

    The desire for more money, or autonomy, leads you to conclude you can do it better,
    faster, or cheaper yourself. Or, maybe the thought of “being your own boss” appeals
    to you. For system administrators, being in business for yourself points to consulting,
    teaching, or freelancing. In all cases, it means directly selling your skills
    to companies. Not to be discouraging, but there are some things you need to know
    before you quit your job and embark on this new adventure.

    own boss. Every customer is your boss. When you work in a company, you generally
    have one manager to whom you report. Not so when you work for yourself. Your job
    now is to attract new customers and retain your current customers. You don’t get
    to call in sick when you feel under the weather, you don’t get to take a lot of
    time off for vacation, and your benefits are entirely your responsibility. This
    is to say, running a business is hard work.

    insurance to protect yourself. Some insurance companies sell errors and omissions
    (E&O) insurance or some other indemnification policy to protect you against fraud,
    mistakes, and unhappy customers. Many community colleges offer business startup
    classes or small business management courses that you can take to test your venture’s
    efficacy.

    Dealing with vacations, sick leave, mistakes, customer care, and coworker interaction
    are all part of employee management. I advise you to state your expectations verbally
    and in writing before an employee begins work. You may do this via an employee
    handbook, one-on-one meetings, or other written and verbal communication forms.
    You should also have periodic meetings to give feedback on employee performance.
    Set up monthly or biweekly meetings to discuss expectations, performance, and
    employee issues. The number one complaint among employees is lack of communication.
    Don’t let it happen on your watch if you’ve been there yourself.

    with compensation and taxes for contractors. You must also set expectations for
    customer care and performance.
  prefs: []

- en: The primary problem with contract labor is that you have no control over their
    time, and control is the determining factor of whether someone is an employee
    or a contractor. Use caution when dictating working parameters so you don’t cross
    the contractor/employee line. Get the advice of an attorney or tax accountant
    for rules governing contractors versus employees. Having contractors reclassified
    as employees by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expensive and detrimental
    to your business. Always engage professional advice for this aspect of your business.
    The IRS or a qualified accountant will assist you in classifying resources as
    employees or contractors.

    what we do but realize that we’re an essential part of the organization. We are
    the *doers* of the org chart. A senior manager once told me (and I’m quoting here),
    “I don’t *do* anything, but I get things done.” I’m sure he saw my eyebrows raise
    as if to say, “Yeah, I know. We all know.” He didn’t respond to my unsubtle reaction
    to his statement. He did have a point, though. The issue was that he wasn’t employed
    to push buttons, pull levers, or reboot computers, but he was in a place to ensure
    someone pulled those levers and pushed those buttons. You see, management is a
    different perspective. Managers carry orders from above and get credit for their
    direct reports. The managers, in turn, are supposed to reward their achievers.
  prefs: []

    shoulders, but the real rewards are dispersed above your pay grade for your work
    via direct reports. Managers have to “play politics,” which means they must strike
    a balance between the people on the front lines, such as the help desk technicians,
    desktop technicians, sysadmins, network admins, database administrators, and so
    on. These direct reports may be overworked, disgruntled, and underappreciated.
    At the same time, your manager’s managers have no clue what the people at the
    bottom of the food chain do to keep the wheels of business turning.

    Second, you will have an automatic career advocate (your mentor), and you need
    an advocate to help you achieve your career goals. Third, it allows you to learn
    people management, corporate culture, and your organization from the top down.
    If you’re a parent, how did you learn to be one? Perhaps from observing your parents.
    I recommend you learn from multiple managers to see different ways of managing
    people and decide for yourself on the best combination of techniques. Learn from
    someone who is not necessarily in your chain of command.

    text-based conversations.

    practice. Get to the point of your conversation early, don’t ramble, and end the
    email with a professional signoff. Keep your email signatures professional too.
    Include your name, phone, company name, department, and title. Quotations and
    witty signoffs are generally unnecessary and often looked at as unprofessional.
    It is appropriate to include your gender pronouns in your signatures, such as
    He/Him, She/Her, or They/Them, and please be respectful of other people’s gender
    pronouns in your communications.

    control over what happens after it leaves your computer. Emails are court-admissible
    and may be used as evidence to incriminate and show a pattern of behavior. Sarcasm,
    jokes, and colloquialisms don’t always have the same effect in email as in spoken
    conversation because the recipient can’t read facial expressions or hear voice
    inflections that clue them into alternative meanings. You should avoid colloquialisms
    when using email to communicate with anyone from a different culture. The possibility
    of insult or misunderstanding is too great.

    email is a popular medium for phishing and scams. No, you haven’t won a contest/lottery/raffle
    that you never entered. No one will deposit any money into your account to help
    them launder money from another country. Delete these attempts when they pass
    through your spam filters. Don’t forward them to anyone. Ransomware, Trojan horse
    malware, and viruses are too common and costly to take any chances. Email can
    be spoofed. An email can look as if it came from a legitimate sender but turn
    out to be deceptive and is often dangerous to open.

    standards of conduct that you should adhere to. Not doing so will give you a bad
    reputation in the business and may limit future opportunities for career moves.
    You want each position to be a stepping stone for the next. You also want a credible
    work history. It’s far more impressive to a potential employer that your former
    manager gives you a recommendation as compared to one from a former colleague.
    Accolades from former customers are also highly regarded if you feel comfortable
    soliciting them. In the following sections, I cover your resignation letter, your
    post-resignation behavior, and how to handle coworkers, managers, and customers

    your current position doesn’t offer, you now have a chance to discuss and negotiate
    them.
