- en: 'The advent of modern computing stacks is radically changing how we think about
    security. In the old data center days, security practitioners thought of software
    applications as medieval castles: securing them involved building big walls with
    small, well-guarded openings. Modern cloud-based software looks more like a bustling
    modern city: people move freely inside it and across its limits to consume and
    provide services and buy, sell, build, and fix things.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As today’s urban planners know, big walls and guarded entrances alone are not
    enough to secure a city. A better approach involves widespread, granular visibility:
    a network of security cameras, for example, plus the ability to view their footage
    and react to any threats they capture in real time.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This book is about security for modern applications, using the open source
    tool that the industry has embraced as the “security camera” for the cloud native
    stack: Falco. Falco is a cloud native runtime security project designed to protect
    software that runs in the cloud by detecting unexpected behavior, intrusions,
    and data theft in real time. It’s the de facto threat detection engine for Kubernetes
    and for cloud infrastructure, deployed by countless users, from single-machine
    test environments to some of the biggest computing environments on the planet.
    We’ll teach you how you can protect applications as they run by detecting threats
    and misconfigurations in workloads and in the cloud infrastructure where they
    operate.'

    to successfully deploy runtime security in your environment, regardless of its
    scale, using Falco. By the time you’ve finished reading the book, you will have
    a solid understanding of how Falco works: you’ll be able to install it in any
    environment, tune its performance, customize it for your needs, collect and interpret
    its data, and even extend it.'

- en: Who Is This Book For?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wrote this book primarily for security operators and architects who want
    to implement runtime security and threat detection in production in their modern
    computing environments. However, we’ve designed it to be approachable even for
    readers with limited or no experience in the field. For that reason, we only require
    that you have familiarity with the most important cloud computing services, with
    containers, and with Kubernetes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ll also cover more advanced topics like deployment at scale, optimization,
    and rule writing that even expert users will find useful. So, even if you are
    familiar with runtime security, and perhaps are already using Falco, this book
    will help you step up your game. The latter part of the book requires basic knowledge
    of programming languages like Go. Developers who want to extend or customize Falco
    will find much value here. Finally, we’ve geared the last chapter of the book
    toward those who are considering becoming Falco contributors—we hope we’ll inspire
    you to join them!
