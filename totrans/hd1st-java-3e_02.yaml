    is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you *are* able to learn and
    remember even the dullest of topics, if you keep pounding on the same thing. With
    enough repetition, your brain says, “This doesn’t *feel* important to him, but
    he keeps looking at the same thing *over* and *over* and *over* , so I suppose
    it must be.”

    different *types* of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big
    part of the solution, and they’re all things that have been proven to help your
    brain work in your favor. For example, studies show that putting words *within*
    the pictures they describe (as opposed to somewhere else in the page, like a caption
    or in the body text) causes your brain to try to makes sense of how the words
    and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. More neurons firing
    = more chances for your brain to *get* that this is something worth paying attention
    to, and possibly recording.

    they perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow
    along and hold up their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily
    *care* that the “conversation” is between you and a book! On the other hand, if
    the writing style is formal and dry, your brain perceives it the same way you
    experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful of passive attendees.

    beginner developers?” Crucially, you helped me to create space and time to work
    on the book, and regularly reminded me why I wanted to take on the project in
    the first place.

    As this second edition goes to print there are now five Head First books, and
    he’s been with us all the way. To **Tim O’Reilly**, for his willingness to launch
    into something *completely* new and different. Thanks to the clever **Kyle Hart**
    for figuring out how Head First fits into the world and for launching the series.
    Finally, to **Edie Freedman** for designing the Head First “emphasize the *head*
    ” cover.
