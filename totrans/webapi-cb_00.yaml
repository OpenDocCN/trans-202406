- en: JavaScript has come a long way since its introduction in late 1995\. In the
    early days, the core APIs built into web browsers were limited. More advanced
    functionality typically required third-party JavaScript libraries, or in some
    cases even browser plug-ins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A web API is a series of global objects and functions exposed by the browser.
    Your JavaScript code can use these to interact with the Document Object Model
    (DOM), perform network communication, integrate with native device features, and
    much more.

    or clunky browser plug-ins. (Remember ActiveX and Flash?)

  prefs: []

    JavaScript libraries. Popular libraries such as jQuery, Lodash, and Moment are
    usually not needed anymore.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using libraries increases the amount of JavaScript the browser has to load.
    Whether it’s bundled with your app or loaded separately from a content delivery
    network (CDN), your browser still has to download it. This translates into potentially
    longer loading times and higher battery usage on mobile devices.

- en: Increased risk
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open source libraries, even popular ones, can be abandoned. When bugs or security
    vulnerabilities are found, there’s no guarantee of an update. Browsers, in general,
    are supported by large companies (the major browsers are from Google, Mozilla,
    Apple, and Microsoft), and it’s more likely that these issues will be fixed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This isn’t to say that third-party libraries are *bad*. There are many benefits
    as well, especially if you need to support older browsers. Like everything in
    software development, library use is a balancing act.
