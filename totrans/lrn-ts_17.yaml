- en: JavaScript has been around for a few decades at this point, and people have
    done quite a lot of odd things with it. TypeScript’s syntax and type system need
    to be able to represent all those odd things to enable any JavaScript developer
    to work with TypeScript. As a result, there are some corners of the TypeScript
    language not seen in most day-to-day code but that are relevant, even necessary,
    for working with some kinds of projects.

- en: I think of these parts of the language as “extra credit” in that you could avoid
    them entirely and still be a productive TypeScript developer. In fact, for the
    logical types introduced toward the end of the section, I would hope you wouldn’t
    need to use them very often—if at all.
