<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>My journey to TypeScript was not a direct or quick one.
I started off in school primarily writing Java, then C++, and like many new developers raised on statically typed languages, I looked down on JavaScript as “just” the sloppy little scripting language people throw onto websites.</p>

<p>My first substantial project in the language was a silly remake of the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> video game in pure HTML5/CSS/JavaScript and, typical of many first projects, was an absolute mess.
In the beginning of the project I instinctively disliked JavaScript’s weird flexibility and lack of guardrails.
It was only toward the end that I really began to respect JavaScript’s features and quirks: its flexibility as a language, its ability to mix and match small functions, and its ability to <em>just work</em> in user browsers within seconds of page load.</p>

<p>By the time I finished that first project, I had fallen in love with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Static analysis (tools that analyze your code without running it) such as TypeScript also gave me a queasy gut feeling at first.
<em>JavaScript is so breezy and fluid</em>, I thought, <em>why bog ourselves down with rigid structures and types?</em>
Were we reverting back to the worlds of Java and C++ that I had left behind?</p>

<p>Coming back to my old projects, it took me all of 10 minutes of struggling to read through my old, convoluted JavaScript code to understand how messy things could get without static analysis.
The act of cleaning that code up showed me all the places I would have benefited from some structure.
From that point on, I was hooked onto adding as much static analysis to my projects as I could.</p>

<p>It’s been nearly a decade since I first tinkered with TypeScript, and I enjoy it as much as ever.
The language is still evolving with new features and is more useful than ever in providing <em>safety</em> and <em>structure</em> to JavaScript.</p>

<p>I hope that by reading <em>Learning TypeScript</em> you can learn to appreciate TypeScript the way I do: not just as a means to find bugs and typos—and certainly not a substantial change to JavaScript code patterns—but as JavaScript <em>with types</em>: a beautiful system for declaring the way our JavaScript should work, and helping us stick to it.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45584707486752">
<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>

<p>If you have an understanding of writing JavaScript code, can run basic commands in a terminal, and are interested in learning about TypeScript, this book is for you.</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve heard TypeScript can help you write a lot of JavaScript with fewer bugs <em>(true!)</em> or document your code well for other people to read <em>(also true!)</em>.
Maybe you’ve seen TypeScript show up in a lot of job postings, or in a new role you’re starting.</p>

<p>Whatever your reason, as long as you come in knowing the fundamentals of JavaScript—variables, functions, closures/scope, and classes—this book will take you from no TypeScript knowledge to mastering the fundamentals and most important features of the language.
By the end of this book, you will understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The history and context for why TypeScript is useful on top of “vanilla” 
<span class="keep-together">JavaScript</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How a type system models code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How a type checker analyzes code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to use development-only type annotations to inform the type system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How TypeScript works with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) to provide code exploration and refactoring tools</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>And you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Articulate the benefits of TypeScript and general characteristics of its type system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add type annotations where useful in your code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Represent moderately complex types using TypeScript’s built-in inferences and new syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use TypeScript to assist local development in refactoring code.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why I Wrote This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45584707523120">
<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>TypeScript is a wildly popular language in both industry and open source:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>GitHub’s 2021 and 2020 State of the Octoverses have it at the platform’s fourth top language, up from seventh in 2019 and 2018 and tenth in 2017.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StackOverflow’s 2021 Developer Survey has it at the world’s third most loved language (72.73% of users).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 2020 State of JS Survey shows TypeScript has consistently high satisfaction and usage amounts as both a build tool and variant of JavaScript.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>For frontend developers, TypeScript is well supported in all major UI libraries and frameworks, including Angular, which strongly recommends TypeScript, as well as Gatsby, Next.js, React, Svelte, and Vue.
For backend developers, TypeScript generates JavaScript that runs natively in Node.js; Deno, a similar runtime by Node’s creator, emphasizes directly supporting TypeScript files.</p>

<p>However, despite this plethora of popular project support, I was rather disappointed by the lack of good introductory content online when I first learned the language.
Many of the online documentation sources didn’t do a great job of explaining what a “type system” is or how to use it.
They often assumed a great deal of prior knowledge in both JavaScript and strongly typed languages, or were written with only cursory code examples.</p>

<p>Not seeing an O’Reilly book with a cute animal cover introducing TypeScript years ago was a disappointment.
While other books on TypeScript from publishers including O’Reilly now exist prior to this one, I couldn’t find a book that focuses on the foundations of the language quite the way I wanted: why it works the way it does and how its core features work together.
A book that starts with a foundational explanation of the language before adding on features one-by-one.
I’m thrilled to be able to make a clear, comprehensive introduction to TypeScript language fundamentals for readers who aren’t already familiar with its principles.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Navigating This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm45584707387632">
<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>

<p><em>Learning TypeScript</em> has two purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You can read through it once to understand TypeScript as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later, you can refer back to it as a practical introductory TypeScript language reference.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This book ramps up from concepts to practical use across three general sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part01.xhtml#concepts">Part I, “Concepts”</a>: How JavaScript came to be, what TypeScript adds to it, and the foundations of a <em>type system</em> as TypeScript creates it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part02.xhtml#features">Part II, “Features”</a>: Fleshing out how the type system interacts with the major parts of JavaScript you’d work with when writing TypeScript code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part03.xhtml#usage">Part III, “Usage”</a>: Now that you understand the features that make up the TypeScript language, how to use them in real-world situations to improve your code reading and editing experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve thrown in a <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part04.xhtml#extra_credit">Part IV, “Extra Credit”</a> section at the end to cover lesser-used but still occasionally useful TypeScript features.
You won’t need to deeply know them to consider yourself a TypeScript developer.
But they’re all useful concepts that will likely come up as you use TypeScript for real-world projects.
Once you’ve finished understanding the first three sections, I highly recommend studying up on the extra credit section.</p>

<p>Each chapter starts with a haiku to get into the spirit of its contents and ends with a pun.
The web development community as a whole and TypeScript’s community within it are known for being jovial and welcoming of newcomers.
I tried to make this book pleasant to read for learners like me who don’t appreciate long, dry 
<span class="keep-together">writings.</span></p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Examples and Projects"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584702366400">
<h2>Examples and Projects</h2>

<p>Unlike many other resources that introduce TypeScript, this book intentionally focuses on introducing language features with standalone examples showing just the new information rather than delving into medium- or large-sized projects.
I prefer this method of teaching because it puts a spotlight on the TypeScript language first and foremost.
TypeScript is useful across so many frameworks and platforms—many of which undergo API updates regularly—that I didn’t want to keep anything framework- or platform-specific in this book.</p>

<p>That being said, it is supremely useful when learning a programming language to exercise concepts immediately after they’re introduced.
I highly recommend taking a break after each chapter to rehearse that chapter’s contents.
Each chapter ends with a suggestion to visit its section on <a href="https://learningtypescript.com"><em class="hyperlink">https://learningtypescript.com</em></a> and work through the examples and projects listed there.</p>
