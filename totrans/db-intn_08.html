<p>Accountants don’t use erasers or they end up in jail.</p>&#13;

</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When accountants have to modify the record, instead of erasing the existing value, they create a new record with a correction. When the quarterly report is published, it may contain minor modifications, correcting the previous quarter results. To derive the bottom line, you have to go through the records and calculate a subtotal <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#HELLAND15">[HELLAND15]</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Similarly, <a data-primary="log-structured storage (LSS)" data-secondary="mutable versus immutable storage" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887704664"/><a data-primary="immutable storage structures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887703816"/>immutable storage structures do not allow modifications to the existing files: tables are written once and are never modified again. Instead, new records are appended to the new file and, to find the final value (or conclude its absence), records have to be reconstructed from multiple files. In contrast, <a data-primary="mutable storage structures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887699736"/>mutable storage structures modify records on disk in place.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Immutable data structures are often used in functional programming languages and are getting more popular because of their safety characteristics: once created, an immutable structure doesn’t change, all of its references can be accessed concurrently, and its integrity is guaranteed by the fact that it cannot be modified.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>On a high level, there is a strict distinction between how data is treated inside a storage structure and outside of it. Internally, immutable files can hold multiple copies, more recent ones overwriting the older ones, while mutable files generally hold only the most recent value instead. When accessed, immutable files are processed, redundant copies are reconciled, and the most recent ones are returned to the client.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As<a data-primary="log-structured merge-trees (LSM trees)" data-secondary="immutable storage offered by" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887698872"/> do other books and papers on the subject, we use B-Trees as a typical example of mutable structure and <em>Log-Structured Merge Trees</em> (LSM Trees) as an example of an immutable structure. Immutable LSM Trees use <a data-primary="append-only structures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887701512"/>append-only storage and <a data-primary="merge reconciliation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887702856"/>merge <span class="keep-together">reconciliation,</span> and B-Trees locate data records on disk and update pages at their original offsets in the file.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In-place update storage<a data-primary="in-place updates" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887693144"/> structures are optimized <a data-primary="read performance" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887695336"/>for read performance <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#GRAEFE04">[GRAEFE04]</a>: after locating data on disk, the record can be returned to the client. This comes at the expense of write performance: to update the data record in place, it first has to be located on disk. On the other hand, append-only storage is optimized for<a data-primary="write performance" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887696216"/> write performance. Writes do not have to locate records on disk to overwrite them. However, this is done at the expense of reads, which have to retrieve multiple data record versions and reconcile them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So far we’ve mostly talked about mutable storage structures. We’ve touched on the subject of immutability while discussing copy-on-write B-Trees (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#copy_on_write_b_tree">“Copy-on-Write”</a>), FD-Trees (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#fd_trees">“FD-Trees”</a>), and Bw-Trees (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#bw_tree">“Bw-Trees”</a>). But there are more ways to implement immutable structures.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Because of the structure and construction approach taken by mutable B-Trees, most I/O operations during reads, writes, and maintenance are <em>random</em>. Each write operation first needs to locate a page that holds a data record and only then can modify it. B-Trees require node splits and merges that relocate already written records. After some time, B-Tree pages may require maintenance. Pages are fixed in size, and some free space is reserved for future writes. Another problem is that even when only one cell in the page is modified, an entire page has to be rewritten.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are alternative approaches that can help to mitigate these problems, make some of the I/O operations sequential, and avoid page rewrites during modifications. One of the ways to do this is to use immutable structures. In this chapter, we’ll focus on LSM Trees: how they’re built, what their properties are, and how they are different from B-Trees.</p>&#13;

<h1>LSM Trees</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When<a data-primary="log-structured storage (LSS)" data-secondary="LSM Trees" data-type="indexterm" id="LSSlsm07"/><a data-primary="log-structured merge-trees (LSM trees)" data-secondary="overview of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887685480"/> talking about B-Trees, we concluded that space overhead and write amplification can be improved by using buffering. Generally, there are two ways <a data-primary="buffering" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887680360"/><a data-primary="buffering" data-see="also buffer management" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887682376"/>buffering can be applied in different storage structures: to postpone propagating writes to disk-resident pages (as we’ve seen with <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#fd_trees">“FD-Trees”</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#wiredtiger">“WiredTiger”</a>), and to make write operations sequential.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One of the most popular immutable on-disk storage structures, LSM Tree uses buffering and <a data-primary="append-only structures" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887676248"/>append-only storage to achieve sequential writes. The LSM Tree is a variant of a disk-resident structure similar to a B-Tree, where nodes are fully occupied, optimized for sequential disk access. This concept was first introduced in a paper by Patrick O’Neil and Edward Cheng <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#ONEIL96">[ONEIL96]</a>. Log-structured merge trees take their name from log-structured filesystems, which write all modifications on disk in a log-like file <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#ROSENBLUM92">[ROSENBLUM92]</a>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>LSM Trees write immutable files and merge them together over time. These files usually contain an index of their own to help readers efficiently locate data. Even though LSM Trees are often presented as an alternative to B-Trees, it is common for B-Trees to be used as the internal indexing structure for an LSM Tree’s immutable files.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The word “merge” in LSM Trees indicates that, due to their immutability, tree contents are merged using an approach similar to merge sort. This happens during maintenance to reclaim space occupied by the redundant copies, and during reads, before contents can be returned to the user.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>LSM Trees defer data file writes and buffer changes in a memory-resident table. These changes are then propagated by writing their contents out to the immutable disk files. All data records remain accessible in memory until the files are fully <span class="keep-together">persisted.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Keeping data files immutable favors sequential writes: data is written on the disk in a single pass and files are append-only. Mutable structures can pre-allocate blocks in a single pass (for example, indexed sequential access method (ISAM) <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#RAMAKRISHNAN03">[RAMAKRISHNAN03]</a> <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#LARSON81">[LARSON81]</a>), but subsequent accesses still require random reads and writes. Immutable structures allow us to lay out data records sequentially to prevent fragmentation. Additionally, immutable files have higher<a data-primary="density" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887673128"/> <em>density</em>: we do not reserve any extra space for data records that are going to be written later, or for the cases when updated records require more space than the originally written ones.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since files are immutable, insert, update, and delete operations do not need to locate data records on disk, which significantly improves write performance and throughput. Instead, duplicate contents are allowed, and conflicts are resolved during the read time. LSM Trees are particularly useful for applications where writes are far more common than reads, which is often the case in modern data-intensive systems, given ever-growing amounts of data and ingest rates.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Reads and writes do not intersect by design, so data on disk can be read and written without segment locking, which significantly simplifies concurrent access. In contrast, mutable structures employ hierarchical locks and latches (you can find more information about locks and latches in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#b_tree_concurrency">“Concurrency Control”</a>) to ensure on-disk data structure integrity, and allow multiple concurrent readers but require exclusive subtree ownership for writers. LSM-based storage engines use linearizable in-memory views of data and index files, and only have to guard concurrent access to the structures managing them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Both B-Trees and LSM Trees require some housekeeping to optimize performance, but for different reasons. Since the number of allocated files steadily grows, LSM Trees have to merge and rewrite files to make sure that the smallest possible number of files is accessed during the read, as requested data records might be spread across multiple files. On the other hand, mutable files may have to be rewritten partially or wholly to decrease fragmentation and reclaim space occupied by updated or deleted records. Of course, the exact scope of work done by the housekeeping process heavily depends on the concrete implementation.</p>&#13;

<h2>LSM Tree Structure</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We<a data-primary="log-structured merge-trees (LSM trees)" data-secondary="structure of" data-type="indexterm" id="LSMstruc07"/> start with ordered LSM Trees <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#ONEIL96">[ONEIL96]</a>, where files hold sorted data records. Later, in <a data-type="xref" href="#unordered_lsm_storage">“Unordered LSM Storage”</a>, we’ll also discuss structures that allow storing data records in insertion order, which has some obvious advantages on the write path.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As we just discussed, LSM Trees consist of smaller memory-resident and larger disk-resident components. To write out immutable file contents on disk, it is necessary to first <em>buffer</em> them in memory and <em>sort</em> their contents.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A <a data-primary="memory-resident components (memtables)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887655000"/>memory-resident component (often called a <em>memtable</em>) is mutable: it buffers data records and serves as a target for read and write operations. Memtable contents are persisted on disk when its size grows up to a configurable threshold. Memtable updates incur no disk access and have no associated I/O costs. A separate write-ahead log file,<a data-primary="write-ahead log (WAL)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887657192"/> similar to what we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#write_ahead_log">“Recovery”</a>, is required to guarantee durability of data records. Data records are appended to the log and committed in memory before the operation is acknowledged to the client.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Buffering is done in memory: all read and write operations are applied to a memory-resident table that maintains a sorted data structure allowing concurrent access, usually some form of an in-memory sorted tree, or any data structure that can give similar performance characteristics.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Disk-resident components are built by<a data-primary="flushing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887649672"/> <em>flushing</em> contents buffered in memory to disk. Disk-resident components are used only for reads: buffered contents are persisted, and files are never modified. This allows us to think in terms of simple operations: writes against an in-memory table, and reads against disk and memory-based tables, merges, and file removals.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout<a data-primary="disk-resident tables" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887653192"/><a data-primary="tables" data-secondary="disk-resident tables" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887645912"/> this chapter, we will be using the word <em>table</em> as a shortcut for <em>disk-resident table</em>. Since we’re discussing semantics of a storage engine, this term is not ambiguous with a <em>table</em> concept in the wider context of a database management <span class="keep-together">system.</span></p>&#13;

<h3>Two-component LSM Tree</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We<a data-primary="two-component LSM Trees" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887642824"/> distinguish between two- and multicomponent LSM Trees. <em>Two-component LSM Trees</em> have only one disk component, comprised of immutable segments. The disk component here is organized as a B-Tree, with 100% node occupancy and read-only pages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Memory-resident tree contents are flushed on disk in parts. During a flush, for each flushed in-memory subtree, we find a corresponding subtree on disk and write out the merged contents of a memory-resident segment and disk-resident subtree into the new segment on disk. <a data-type="xref" href="#two_component_lsm_tree_1">Figure 7-1</a> shows in-memory and disk-resident trees before a merge.</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-1. </span>Two-component LSM Tree before a flush. Flushing memory- and disk-resident segments are shown in gray.</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After the subtree is flushed, superseded memory-resident and disk-resident subtrees are discarded and replaced with the result of their merge, which becomes addressable from the preexisting sections of the disk-resident tree. <a data-type="xref" href="#two_component_lsm_tree_2">Figure 7-2</a> shows the result of a merge process, already written to the new location on disk and attached to the rest of the tree.</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-2. </span>Two-component LSM Tree after a flush. Merged contents are shown in gray. Boxes with dashed lines depict discarded on-disk segments.</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A merge can be implemented by advancing iterators reading the disk-resident leaf nodes and contents of the in-memory tree in lockstep. Since both sources are sorted, to produce a sorted merged result, we only need to know the <em>current</em> values of both iterators during each step of the merge process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This approach is a logical extension and continuation of our conversation on immutable B-Trees. Copy-on-write B-Trees (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#copy_on_write_b_tree">“Copy-on-Write”</a>) use B-Tree structure, but their nodes are not fully occupied, and they require copying pages on the root-leaf path and creating a <em>parallel</em> tree structure. Here, we do something similar, but since we buffer writes in memory, we amortize the costs of the disk-resident tree update.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When implementing subtree merges and flushes, we have to make sure of three things:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>As soon as</em> the flush process starts, all new writes have to go to the new memtable.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>During</em> the subtree flush, both the disk-resident and flushing memory-resident subtree have to remain accessible for reads.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>After</em> the flush, publishing merged contents, and discarding unmerged disk- and memory-resident contents have to be performed atomically.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even though two-component LSM Trees can be useful for maintaining index files, no implementations are known to the author as of time of writing. This can be explained by the write amplification characteristics of this approach: merges are relatively frequent, as they are triggered by memtable flushes.</p>&#13;

<h3>Multicomponent LSM Trees</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s consider<a data-primary="multicomponent LSM Trees" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887623960"/> an alternative design, multicomponent LSM Trees that have more than just one disk-resident table. In this case, entire memtable contents are flushed in a single run.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It quickly becomes evident that after multiple flushes we’ll end up with multiple disk-resident tables, and their number will only grow over time. Since we do not always know exactly which tables are holding required data records, we might have to access multiple files to locate the searched data.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Having to read from multiple sources instead of just one might get expensive. To mitigate this problem and keep the number of tables to minimum, a periodic merge process called<a data-primary="compaction" data-secondary="process of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887622728"/> <em>compaction</em> (see <a data-type="xref" href="#compaction">“Maintenance in LSM Trees”</a>) is triggered. Compaction picks several tables, reads their contents, merges them, and writes the merged result out to the new combined file. Old tables are discarded simultaneously with the appearance of the new merged table.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#multi_component_lsm_tree">Figure 7-3</a> shows the multicomponent LSM Tree data life cycle. Data is first buffered in a memory-resident component. When it gets too large, its contents are flushed on disk to create disk-resident tables. Later, multiple tables are merged together to create larger tables.</p>&#13;

Before it can be flushed, the memtable has to be <em>switched</em>: a new memtable is allocated, and it becomes a target for all new writes, while the old one moves to the flushing state. These two steps have to be performed atomically. The flushing memtable remains available for reads until its contents are fully flushed. After this, the old memtable is discarded in favor of a newly written disk-resident table, which becomes available for reads.</p>&#13;

<h2>Updates and Deletes</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In<a data-primary="log-structured merge-trees (LSM trees)" data-secondary="updates and deletes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887592888"/> LSM Trees, insert, update, and delete operations do not require locating data records on disk. Instead, redundant records are reconciled during the read.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Removing data records from the memtable is not enough, since other disk or memory resident tables may hold data records for the same key. If we were to implement deletes by just removing items from the memtable, we would end up with deletes that either have no impact or would <em>resurrect</em> the previous values.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s consider an example. The flushed disk-resident table contains data record <code>v1</code> associated with a key <code>k1</code>, and the memtable holds its new value <code>v2</code>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Disk Table        Memtable&#13;
| k1 | v1 |       | k1 | v2 |</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If we just remove <code>v2</code> from the memtable and flush it, we effectively resurrect <code>v1</code>, since it becomes the only value associated with that key:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Disk Table        Memtable&#13;
| k1 | v1 |       ∅</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Because<a data-primary="delete entry" data-seealso="tombstones" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887587288"/><a data-primary="tombstones" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887584392"/><a data-primary="dormant certificates" data-seealso="tombstones" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887583784"/> of that, deletes need to be recorded <em>explicitly</em>. This can be done by inserting a special <em>delete entry</em> (sometimes called a <em>tombstone</em> or a <em>dormant certificate</em>), indicating removal of the data record associated with a specific key:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Disk Table        Memtable&#13;
| k1 | v1 |       | k1 | &lt;tombstone&gt; |</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The reconciliation process picks up tombstones, and filters out the shadowed values.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Sometimes it might be useful to remove a consecutive range of keys rather than just a single key. This can be done<a data-primary="predicate deletes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887579320"/> using <em>predicate deletes</em>, which work by appending a delete entry with a predicate that sorts according to regular record-sorting rules. During reconciliation, data records matching the predicate are skipped and not returned to the client.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Predicates can take a form of <code>DELETE FROM table WHERE key ≥ "k2" AND key &lt; "k4"</code> and can receive any range matchers. Apache Cassandra<a data-primary="Apache Cassandra" data-secondary="range tombstones in" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887575768"/> implements this approach and calls<a data-primary="range tombstones" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887576632"/> it <em>range tombstones</em>. A range tombstone covers a range of keys rather than just a single key.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When using range tombstones, resolution rules have to be carefully considered because of overlapping ranges and disk-resident table boundaries. For example, the following combination will hide data records associated with <code>k2</code> and <code>k3</code> from the final result:</p>&#13;

<h2>Merge-Iteration</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since<a data-primary="log-structured merge-trees (LSM trees)" data-secondary="merge-iteration" data-type="indexterm" id="LSMTmerge07"/><a data-primary="merge-iteration" data-type="indexterm" id="merit07"/> contents of disk-resident tables are sorted, we can use a multiway merge-sort algorithm. For example, we have three sources: two disk-resident tables and one memtable. Usually, storage engines<a data-primary="cursors" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887565384"/><a data-primary="iterators" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887564712"/> offer a <em>cursor</em> or an <em>iterator</em> to navigate through file contents. This cursor holds the offset of the last consumed data record, can be checked for whether or not iteration has finished, and can be used to retrieve the next data record.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A multiway merge-sort<a data-primary="priority queues" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887560504"/><a data-primary="min-heap" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887559656"/> uses a <em>priority queue</em>, such as <em>min-heap</em> <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#SEDGEWICK11">[SEDGEWICK11]</a>, that holds up to <code>N</code> elements (where <code>N</code> is the number of iterators), which sorts its contents and prepares the next-in-line smallest element to be returned. The head of each iterator is placed into the queue. An element in the head of the queue is then the minimum of all iterators.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>A priority queue is a data structure used for maintaining an ordered queue of items. While a regular queue retains items in order of their addition (first in, first out), a priority queue re-sorts items on insertion and the item with the highest (or lowest) priority is placed in the head of the queue. This is particularly useful for merge-iteration, since we have to output elements in a sorted order.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When the smallest element is removed from the queue, the iterator associated with it is checked for the next value, which is then placed into the queue, which is re-sorted to preserve the order.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since all iterator contents are sorted, reinserting a value from the iterator that held the previous smallest value of all iterator heads also preserves an invariant that the queue still holds the smallest elements from all iterators. Whenever one of the iterators is exhausted, the algorithm proceeds without reinserting the next iterator head. The algorithm continues until either query conditions are satisfied or all iterators are exhausted.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#lsm_merge">Figure 7-5</a> shows a schematic representation of the merge process just described: head elements (light gray items in source tables) are placed to the priority queue. Elements from the priority queue are returned to the output iterator. The resulting output is sorted.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It may happen that we encounter more than one data record for the same key during merge-iteration. From the priority queue and iterator invariants, we know that if each iterator only holds a single data record per key, and we end up with multiple records for the same key in the queue, these data records must have come from the different iterators.</p>&#13;
&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-5. </span>LSM merge mechanics</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s follow through one example step-by-step. As input data, we have iterators over two disk-resident tables:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Iterator 1:         Iterator 2:&#13;
{k2: v1} {k4: v2}   {k1: v3} {k2: v4} {k3: v5}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The priority queue is filled from the iterator heads:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Iterator 1:         Iterator 2:         Priority queue:&#13;
{k4: v2}            {k2: v4} {k3: v5}   {k1: v3} {k2: v1}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Key <code>k1</code> is the smallest key in the queue and is appended to the result. Since it came from <code>Iterator 2</code>, we refill the queue from it:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Iterator 1:         Iterator 2:         Priority queue:      Merged Result:&#13;
{k4: v2}            {k3: v5}            {k2: v1} {k2: v4}    {k1: v3}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now, we have <em>two</em> records for the <code>k2</code> key in the queue. We can be sure there are no other records with the same key in any iterator because of the aforementioned invariants. Same-key records are merged and appended to the merged result.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">The queue is refilled with data from both iterators:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Iterator 1:         Iterator 2:         Priority queue:      Merged Result:&#13;
{}                  {}                  {k3: v5} {k4: v2}    {k1: v3} {k2: v4}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since all iterators are now empty, we append the remaining queue contents to the output:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Merged Result:&#13;
  {k1: v3} {k2: v4} {k3: v5} {k4: v2}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In summary, the following steps have to be repeated to create a combined iterator:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Initially, fill the queue with the first items from each iterator.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Take the smallest element (head) from the queue.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Refill the queue from the corresponding iterator, unless this iterator is exhausted.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In terms of complexity, merging iterators is the same as merging sorted collections. It has <code>O(N)</code> memory overhead, where <code>N</code> is the number of iterators. A sorted collection of iterator heads is maintained with <code>O(log N)</code> (average case) <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#KNUTH98">[KNUTH98]</a>.<a data-primary="" data-startref="merit07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887533592"/><a data-startref="LSMTmerge07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887531320"/></p>&#13;

Another important aspect is <em>reconciliation</em> and <em>conflict resolution</em> of the data records associated with the same key.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Different tables might hold data records for the same key, such as updates and deletes, and their contents have to be reconciled. The priority queue implementation from the preceding example must be able to allow multiple values associated with the same key and trigger reconciliation.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>An operation that inserts the record to the database if it does not exist, and updates an existing one otherwise, is called<a data-primary="upserts" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887522408"/> an <em>upsert</em>. In LSM Trees, insert and update operations are indistinguishable, since they do not attempt to locate data records previously associated with the key in all sources and reassign its value, so we can say that we <em>upsert</em> records by default.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To reconcile data records, we need to understand which one of them takes precedence. Data records hold metadata necessary for this, such as timestamps. To <span class="keep-together">establish</span> the order between the items coming from multiple sources and find out which one is more recent, we can compare their timestamps.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Records shadowed by the records with higher timestamps are not returned to the client or written during compaction.</p>&#13;

<h2>Maintenance in LSM Trees</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Similar<a data-primary="log-structured merge-trees (LSM trees)" data-secondary="maintenance in" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887522840"/> to mutable B-Trees, LSM Trees require maintenance. The nature of these processes is heavily influenced by the invariants these algorithms preserve.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In B-Trees, the maintenance process collects unreferenced cells and defragments the pages, reclaiming the space occupied by removed and shadowed records. In LSM Trees, the number of disk-resident tables is constantly growing, but can be reduced by triggering periodic compaction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Compaction picks multiple disk-resident tables, iterates over their entire contents using the aforementioned merge and reconciliation algorithms, and writes out the results into the newly created table.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since disk-resident table contents are sorted, and because of the way merge-sort works, compaction has a theoretical memory usage upper bound, since it should only hold iterator heads in memory. All table contents are consumed sequentially, and the resulting merged data is also written out sequentially. These details may vary between implementations due to additional optimizations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Compacting tables remain available for reads until the compaction process finishes, which means that for the duration of compaction, it is required to have enough free space available on disk for a compacted table to be written.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At any given time, multiple compactions can be executed in the system. However, these concurrent compactions usually work on nonintersecting sets of tables. A compaction writer can both merge several tables into one and partition one table into multiple tables.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>During compaction, tombstones are not dropped right away. They are preserved until the storage engine can be certain that no data record for the same key with a smaller timestamp is present in any other table. RocksDB keeps tombstones until they <a href="https://databass.dev/links/74">reach the bottommost level</a>. Apache Cassandra keeps tombstones until the <a href="https://databass.dev/links/75">GC (garbage collection) grace period is reached</a> because of the eventually consistent nature of the database, ensuring that other nodes observe the tombstone. Preserving tombstones during compaction is important to avoid data resurrection.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Leveled compaction" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="idm46466887515448">&#13;
<h3>Leveled compaction</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Compaction<a data-primary="leveled compaction" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887504392"/><a data-primary="compaction" data-secondary="leveled compaction" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887506584"/> opens up multiple opportunities for optimizations, and there are many different compaction strategies. One of the frequently implemented compaction strategies is called <em>leveled compaction</em>. For example, it is used by <a href="https://databass.dev/links/76">RocksDB</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Leveled compaction separates disk-resident tables into <em>levels</em>. Tables on each level have target sizes, and each level has a corresponding <em>index</em> number (identifier). Somewhat counterintuitively, the level with the highest index is called the <em>bottommost</em> level. For clarity, this section avoids using terms <em>higher</em> and <em>lower level</em> and uses the same qualifiers for <em>level index</em>. That is, since 2 is larger than 1, level 2 has a higher index than level 1. The terms <em>previous</em> and <em>next</em> have the same order semantics as level indexes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Level-0 tables are created by flushing memtable contents. Tables in level 0 may contain overlapping key ranges. As soon as the number of tables on level 0 reaches a threshold, their contents are merged, creating new tables for level 1.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Key ranges for the tables on level 1 and all levels with a higher index do not overlap, so level-0 tables have to be partitioned during compaction, split into ranges, and merged with tables holding corresponding key ranges. Alternatively, compaction can include <em>all</em> level-0 and level-1 tables, and output partitioned level-1 tables.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Compactions on the levels with the higher indexes pick tables from two consecutive levels with overlapping ranges and produce a new table on a higher level. <a data-type="xref" href="#leveled_compaction">Figure 7-6</a> schematically shows how the compaction process migrates data between the levels. The process of compacting level-1 and level-2 tables will produce a new table on level 2. Depending on how tables are partitioned, multiple tables from one level can be picked for compaction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="leveled_compaction">&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-6. </span>Compaction process. Gray boxes with dashed lines represent currently compacting tables. Level-wide boxes represent the target data size limit on the level. Level 1 is over the limit.</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Keeping different key ranges in the distinct tables reduces the number of tables accessed during the read. This is done by inspecting the table metadata and filtering out the tables whose ranges do not contain a searched key.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each level has a limit on the table size and the maximum number of tables. As soon as the number of tables on level 1 or any level with a higher index reaches a threshold, tables from the <em>current</em> level are merged with tables on the <em>next</em> level holding the overlapping key range.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Sizes grow exponentially between the levels: tables on each next level are exponentially larger than tables on the previous one. This way, the freshest data is always on the level with the lowest index, and older data gradually migrates to the higher ones.</p>&#13;

In size-tiered compaction, rather than grouping disk-resident tables based on their level, they’re grouped by size: smaller tables are grouped with smaller ones, and bigger tables are grouped with bigger ones.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Level 0 holds the smallest tables that were either flushed from memtables or created by the compaction process. When the tables are compacted, the resulting merged table is written to the level holding tables with corresponding sizes. The process continues recursively incrementing levels, compacting and promoting larger tables to higher levels, and demoting smaller tables to lower levels.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>&#13;
<p>One<a data-primary="table starvation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887481016"/> of the problems with size-tiered compaction is called <em>table starvation</em>: if compacted tables are still small enough after compaction (e.g., records were shadowed by the tombstones and did not make it to the merged table), higher levels may get starved of compaction and their tombstones will not be taken into consideration, increasing the cost of reads. In this case, compaction has to be forced for a level, even if it doesn’t contain enough tables.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There<a data-primary="time window compaction" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887475368"/><a data-primary="compaction" data-secondary="time window compaction" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887474760"/> are other commonly implemented compaction strategies that might optimize for different workloads. For example, <a data-primary="Apache Cassandra" data-secondary="time window compaction in" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887479560"/>Apache Cassandra also implements <a href="https://databass.dev/links/77">a <em>time window</em> compaction strategy</a>, which is particularly useful for time-series workloads with records for which time-to-live is set (in other words, items have to be expired after a given time period).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The time window compaction strategy takes write timestamps into consideration and allows dropping entire files that hold data for an already expired time range without requiring us to compact and rewrite their contents.<a data-primary="" data-startref="LSSlsm07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887474104"/></p>&#13;

<p>When implementing<a data-primary="log-structured storage (LSS)" data-secondary="read, write, and space amplification" data-type="indexterm" id="LSSread07"/><a data-primary="read amplification" data-type="indexterm" id="readam07"/><a data-primary="write amplification" data-type="indexterm" id="writeamp07"/><a data-primary="space amplification" data-type="indexterm" id="spamp07"/> an optimal compaction strategy, we have to take multiple factors into consideration. One approach is to reclaim space occupied by duplicate records and reduce space overhead, which results in higher write amplification caused by re-writing tables continuously. The alternative is to avoid rewriting the data continuously, which increases read amplification (overhead from reconciling data records associated with the same key during the read), and space amplification (since redundant records are preserved for a longer time).</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>One of the big disputes in the database community is whether B-Trees or LSM Trees have lower write amplification. It is extremely important to understand the <em>source</em> of write amplification in both cases. In B-Trees, it comes from writeback operations and subsequent updates to the same node. In LSM Trees, write amplification is caused by migrating data from one file to the other during compaction. Comparing the two directly may lead to incorrect <span class="keep-together">assumptions.</span></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In summary, when storing data on disk in an immutable fashion, we face three <span class="keep-together">problems:</span></p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="RUM Conjecture" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm46466887462792">&#13;
<h2>RUM Conjecture</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One<a data-primary="RUM Conjecture" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887458552"/> of the popular cost models for storage structures takes three factors into consideration: <em>R</em>ead, <em>U</em>pdate, and <em>M</em>emory overheads. It is called RUM Conjecture <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#ATHANASSOULIS16">[ATHANASSOULIS16]</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>RUM Conjecture states that reducing two of these overheads inevitably leads to change for the worse in the third one, and that optimizations can be done only at the expense of one of the three parameters. We can compare different storage engines in terms of these three parameters to understand which ones they optimize for, and which potential trade-offs this may imply.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>An ideal solution would provide the lowest read cost while maintaining low memory and write overheads, but in reality, this is not achievable, and we are presented with a trade-off.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>B-Trees are read-optimized. Writes to the B-Tree require locating a record on disk, and subsequent writes to the same page might have to update the page on disk multiple times. Reserved extra space for future updates and deletes increases space <span class="keep-together">overhead.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>LSM Trees do not require locating the record on disk during write and do not reserve extra space for future writes. There is still some space overhead resulting from storing redundant records. In a default configuration, reads are more expensive, since multiple tables have to be accessed to return complete results. However, optimizations we discuss in this chapter help to mitigate this problem.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As we’ve seen in the chapters about B-Trees, and will see in this chapter, there are ways to improve these characteristics by applying different optimizations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This cost model is not perfect, as it does not take into account other important metrics such as latency, access patterns, implementation complexity, maintenance overhead, and hardware-related specifics. Higher-level concepts important for distributed databases, such as consistency implications and replication overhead, are also not considered. However, this model can be used as a first approximation and a rule of thumb as it helps understand what the <em>storage engine</em> has to offer.<a data-primary="" data-startref="spamp07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887453096"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="writeamp07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887450648"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="readam07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887449704"/><a data-primary="" data-startref="LSSread07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887444376"/></p>&#13;

<h1>Implementation Details</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We’ve<a data-primary="log-structured storage (LSS)" data-secondary="implementation details" data-type="indexterm" id="LSSimpl07"/> covered the basic dynamics of LSM Trees: how data is read, written, and compacted. However, there are some other things that many LSM Tree implementations have in common that are worth discussing: how memory- and disk-resident tables are implemented, how secondary indexes work, how to reduce the number of disk-resident tables accessed during read and, finally, new ideas related to log-structured storage.</p>&#13;

<h2>Sorted String Tables</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So far we’ve discussed the hierarchical and logical structure of LSM Trees (that they consist of multiple memory- and disk-resident components), but have not yet discussed how disk-resident tables are implemented and how their design plays together with the rest of the system.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Disk-resident tables<a data-primary="Sorted String Tables (SSTables)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887441320"/><a data-primary="tables" data-secondary="Sorted String Tables (SSTables)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887440712"/> are often implemented using <em>Sorted String Tables</em> (SSTables). As the name suggests, data records in SSTables are sorted and laid out in key order. SSTables usually consist of two components: index files and data files. Index files are implemented using some structure allowing logarithmic lookups, such as B-Trees, or constant-time lookups, such as hashtables.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since data files hold records in key order, using hashtables for indexing does not prevent us from implementing range scans, as a hashtable is only accessed to locate the first key in the range, and the range itself can be read from the data file sequentially while the range predicate still matches.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The index component holds keys and data entries (offsets in the data file where the actual data records are located). The data component consists of concatenated key-value pairs. The cell design and data record formats we discussed in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#file_formats">Chapter 3</a> are largely applicable to SSTables. The main difference here is that cells are written sequentially and are not modified during the life cycle of the SSTable. Since the index files hold pointers to the data records stored in the data file, their offsets have to be known by the time the index is created.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During compaction, data files can be read sequentially without addressing the index component, as data records in them are already ordered. Since tables merged during compaction have the same order, and merge-iteration is order-preserving, the resulting merged table is also created by writing data records sequentially in a single run. As soon as the file is fully written, it is considered immutable, and its disk-resident contents are not modified.</p>&#13;

<h5>SSTable-Attached Secondary Indexes</h5>&#13;
<p>One<a data-primary="SSTable-Attached Secondary Indexes (SASI)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887434168"/><a data-primary="indexes" data-secondary="SSTable-Attached Secondary Indexes (SASI)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887433432"/> of the interesting developments in the area of LSM Tree indexing is <em>SSTable-Attached Secondary Indexes</em> (SASI) implemented in Apache Cassandra. To allow indexing table contents not just by the primary key, but also by any other field, index structures and their life cycles are coupled with the SSTable life cycle, and an index is created per SSTable. When the memtable is flushed, its contents are written to disk, and secondary index files are created along with the SSTable primary key index.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since LSM Trees buffer data in memory and indexes have to work for memory-resident contents as well as the disk-resident ones, SASI maintains a separate in-memory structure, indexing memtable contents.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During a read, primary keys of searched records are located by searching and merging index contents, and data records are merged and reconciled similar to how lookups usually work in LSM Trees.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One of the advantages of piggybacking the SSTable life cycle is that indexes can be created during memtable flush or compaction.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Bloom Filters" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="bloom_filter">&#13;
<h2>Bloom Filters</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The<a data-primary="Bloom filters" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887423752"/> source of read amplification in LSM Trees is that we have to address multiple disk-resident tables for the read operation to complete. This happens because we do not always know up front whether or not a disk-resident table contains a data record for the searched key.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>One of the ways to prevent table lookup is to store its key range (smallest and largest keys stored in the given table) in metadata, and check if the searched key belongs to the range of that table. This information is imprecise and can only tell us if the data record <em>can</em> be present in the table. To improve this situation, many implementations, including <a href="https://databass.dev/links/78">Apache Cassandra</a> and <a href="https://databass.dev/links/79">RocksDB</a>, use a data structure called a <em>Bloom filter</em>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Probabilistic data structures are generally more space efficient than their “regular” counterparts. For example, to check set membership, cardinality (find out the number of distinct elements in a set), or frequency (find out how many times a certain element has been encountered), we would have to store all set elements and go through the entire dataset to find the result. Probabilistic structures allow us to store approximate information and perform queries that yield results with an element of uncertainty. Some commonly known examples of such data structures are a Bloom filter (for set membership), HyperLogLog (for cardinality estimation) <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#FLAJOLET12">[FLAJOLET12]</a>, and Count-Min Sketch (for frequency estimation) <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#CORMODE12">[CORMODE12]</a>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A <em>Bloom filter</em>, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970 <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#BLOOM70">[BLOOM70]</a>, is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that can be used to test whether the element is a member of the set or not. It can produce false-positive matches (say that the element is a member of the set, while it is not present there), but cannot produce false negatives (if a negative match is returned, the element is guaranteed not to be a member of the set).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In other words, a Bloom filter can be used to tell if the key <em>might be in the table</em> or <em>is definitely not in the table</em>. Files for which a Bloom filter returns a negative match are skipped during the query. The rest of the files are accessed to find out if the data record is actually present. Using Bloom filters associated with disk-resident tables helps to significantly reduce the number of tables accessed during a read.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A Bloom filter uses a large bit array and multiple hash functions. Hash functions are applied to keys of the records in the table to find indices in the bit array, bits for which are set to <code>1</code>. Bits set to <code>1</code> in all positions determined by the hash functions indicate a <em>presence</em> of the key in the set. During lookup, when checking for element presence in a Bloom filter, hash functions are calculated for the key again and, if bits determined by <em>all</em> hash functions are <code>1</code>, we return the positive result stating that item is a member of the set with a certain probability. If at least one of the bits is <code>0</code>, we can precisely say that element is not present in the set.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Hash<a data-primary="hash collision" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887417032"/> functions applied to different keys can return the same bit position and result in a <em>hash collision</em>, and <code>1</code> bits only imply that <em>some</em> hash function has yielded this bit position for <em>some</em> key.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Probability of false positives is managed by configuring the size of the bit set and the number of hash functions: in a larger bit set, there’s a smaller chance of collision; similarly, having more hash functions, we can check more bits and have a more precise outcome.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The larger bit set occupies more memory, and computing results of more hash functions may have a negative performance impact, so we have to find a reasonable <span class="keep-together">middle</span> ground between acceptable probability and incurred overhead. Probability can be calculated from the expected set size. Since tables in LSM Trees are immutable, set size (number of keys in the table) is known up front.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s take a look at a simple example, shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#bloom_filter_1">Figure 7-7</a>. We have a 16-way bit array and 3 hash functions, which yield values <code>3</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>10</code> for <code>key1</code>. We now set bits at these positions. The next key is added and hash functions yield values of <code>5</code>, <code>8</code>, and <code>14</code> for <code>key2</code>, for which we set bits, too.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure class="width-75"><div class="figure" id="bloom_filter_1">&#13;
<img alt="dbin 0707" src="assets/dbin_0707.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-7. </span>Bloom filter</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now, we’re trying to check whether or not <code>key3</code> is present in the set, and hash functions yield <code>3</code>, <code>10</code>, and <code>14</code>. Since all three bits were set when adding <code>key1</code> and <code>key2</code>, we have a situation in which the Bloom filter returns a false positive: <code>key3</code> was never appended there, yet all of the calculated bits are set. However, since the Bloom filter only claims that element <em>might</em> be in the table, this result is acceptable.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If we try to perform a lookup for <code>key4</code> and receive values of <code>5</code>, <code>9</code>, and <code>15</code>, we find that only bit <code>5</code> is set, and the other two bits are unset. If even one of the bits is unset, we know for sure that the element was never appended to the filter.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Skiplist" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="skiplist">&#13;
<h2>Skiplist</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There<a data-primary="skiplists" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887389016"/> are many different data structures for keeping sorted data in memory, and one that has been getting more popular recently because of its simplicity is called a <em>skiplist</em> <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#PUGH90b">[PUGH90b]</a>. Implementation-wise, a skiplist is not much more complex than a singly-linked list, and its probabilistic complexity guarantees are close to those of search trees.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Skiplists do not require rotation or relocation for inserts and updates, and use probabilistic balancing instead. Skiplists are generally less cache-friendly than in-memory B-Trees, since skiplist nodes are small and randomly allocated in memory. Some implementations improve the situation by using <a href="https://databass.dev/links/80">unrolled linked lists</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A skiplist consists of a series of nodes of a different <em>height</em>, building linked hierarchies allowing to skip ranges of items. Each node holds a key, and, unlike the nodes in a linked list, some nodes have more than just one successor. A node of height <code>h</code> is linked <em>from</em> one or more predecessor nodes of a height <em>up to</em> <code>h</code>. Nodes on the lowest level can be linked from nodes of any height.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Node height is determined by a random function and is computed during insert. Nodes that have the same height form a <em>level</em>. The number of levels is capped to avoid infinite growth, and a maximum height is chosen based on how many items can be held by the structure. There are exponentially fewer nodes on each next level.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lookups work by following the node pointers on the highest level. As soon as the search encounters the node that holds a key that is <em>greater than</em> the searched one, its predecessor’s link to the node on the next level is followed. In other words, if the searched key is <em>greater than</em> the current node key, the search continues forward. If the searched key is <em>smaller than</em> the current node key, the search continues from the predecessor node on the next level. This process is repeated recursively until the searched key or its predecessor is located.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, searching for key 7 in the skiplist shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#skiplist_example">Figure 7-8</a> can be done as follows:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Follow the pointer on the highest level, to the node that holds key <code>10</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Since the searched key <code>7</code> is <em>smaller than</em> <code>10</code>, the next-level pointer from the head node is followed, locating a node holding key <code>5</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The highest-level pointer on this node is followed, locating the node holding key <code>10</code> again.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The searched key <code>7</code> is <em>smaller than</em> <code>10</code>, and the next-level pointer from the node holding key <code>5</code> is followed, locating a node holding the searched key <code>7</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="skiplist_example">&#13;
<img alt="dbin 0708" src="assets/dbin_0708.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-8. </span>Skiplist</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During insert, an insertion point (node holding a key or its predecessor) is found using the aforementioned algorithm, and a new node is created. To build a tree-like hierarchy and keep balance, the height of the node is determined using a random number, generated based on a probability distribution. Pointers in predecessor nodes holding keys <em>smaller than</em> the key in a newly created node are linked to point to that node. Their higher-level pointers remain intact. Pointers in the newly created node are linked to corresponding successors on each level.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During delete, forward pointers of the removed node are placed to predecessor nodes on corresponding levels.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We can create a concurrent version of a skiplist by implementing a linearizability scheme that uses an additional <code>fully_linked</code> flag that determines whether or not the node pointers are fully updated. This flag can be set using compare-and-swap <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#HERLIHY10">[HERLIHY10]</a>. This is required because the node pointers have to be updated on multiple levels to fully restore the skiplist structure.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In<a data-primary="hazard pointers" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887362728"/> languages with an unmanaged memory model, reference counting or <em>hazard pointers</em> can be used to ensure that currently referenced nodes are not freed while they are accessed concurrently <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#RUSSEL12">[RUSSEL12]</a>. This algorithm is deadlock-free, since nodes are always accessed from higher levels.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Apache Cassandra uses skiplists for the secondary <a href="https://databass.dev/links/81">index memtable implementation</a>. WiredTiger uses skiplists for some in-memory <span class="keep-together">operations.</span></p>&#13;

<h2>Disk Access</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since most of the table contents are disk-resident, and storage devices generally allow accessing data blockwise, many LSM Tree implementations rely on the page cache for disk accesses and intermediate caching. Many techniques described in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#buffer_pool">“Buffer Management”</a>, such as page eviction and pinning, still apply to log-structured storage.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The most notable difference is that in-memory contents are immutable and therefore require no additional locks or latches for concurrent access. Reference counting is applied to make sure that currently accessed pages are not evicted from memory, and in-flight requests complete before underlying files are removed during compaction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another difference is that data records in LSM Trees are not necessarily page aligned, and pointers can be implemented using absolute offsets rather than page IDs for addressing. In <a data-type="xref" href="#lsm_reading_mid_block">Figure 7-9</a>, you can see records with contents that are not aligned with disk blocks. Some records cross the page boundaries and require loading several pages in memory.</p>&#13;

<h2>Compression</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We’ve<a data-primary="compression" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887348120"/><a data-primary="data" data-secondary="compressing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887347512"/> discussed compression already in context of B-Trees (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#b_tree_compression">“Compression”</a>). Similar ideas are also applicable to LSM Trees. The main difference here is that LSM Tree tables are immutable, and are generally written in a single pass. When compressing data page-wise, compressed pages are not page aligned, as their sizes are smaller than that of uncompressed ones.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To be able to address compressed pages, we need to keep track of the address boundaries when writing their contents. We could fill compressed pages with zeros, aligning them to the page size, but then we’d lose the benefits of compression.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To make compressed pages addressable, we need an indirection layer which stores offsets and sizes of compressed pages. <a data-type="xref" href="#compression_in_lsm">Figure 7-10</a> shows the mapping between compressed and uncompressed blocks. Compressed pages are <em>always</em> smaller than the originals, since otherwise there’s no point in compressing them.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>During compaction and flush, compressed pages are appended sequentially, and compression information (the original uncompressed page offset and the actual compressed page offset) is stored in a separate file segment. During the read, the compressed page offset and its size are looked up, and the page can be uncompressed and materialized in memory.<a data-primary="" data-startref="LSSimpl07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887341592"/></p>&#13;

Mutable and immutable B-Tree pages, sorted runs in FD-Trees, and SSTables in LSM Trees store data records in key order.

<p>In this section, we discuss structures that store records in random order. Unordered stores generally do not require a separate log and allow us to reduce the cost of writes by storing data records in insertion order.</p>&#13;

<h2>Bitcask</h2>&#13;

Unlike the log-structured storage implementations discussed so far, it <em>does not</em> use memtables for buffering, and stores data records directly in logfiles.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To make values searchable, Bitcask uses a<a data-primary="keydir" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887324792"/> data structure called <em>keydir</em>, which holds references to the <em>latest</em> data records for the corresponding keys. Old data records may still be present on disk, but are not referenced from keydir, and are garbage-collected during compaction. Keydir is implemented as an in-memory hashmap and has to be rebuilt from the logfiles during startup.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During a <em>write</em>, a key and a data record are appended to the logfile sequentially, and the pointer to the newly written data record location is placed in keydir.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Reads check the keydir to locate the searched key and follow the associated pointer to the logfile, locating the data record. Since at any given moment there can be only one value associated with the key in the keydir, point queries do not have to merge data from multiple sources.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#bitcask_architecture">Figure 7-11</a> shows mapping between the keys and records in data files in Bitcask. Logfiles hold data records, and keydir points to the latest <em>live</em> data record associated with each key. Shadowed records in data files (ones that were superseded by later writes or deletes) are shown in gray.</p>&#13;
&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During compaction, contents of all logfiles are read sequentially, merged, and written to a new location, preserving only <em>live</em> data records and discarding the shadowed ones. Keydir is updated with new pointers to relocated data records.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Data records are stored directly in logfiles, so a separate write-ahead log doesn’t have to be maintained, which reduces both space overhead and write amplification. A downside of this approach is that it offers only point queries and doesn’t allow range scans, since items are unordered both in keydir and in data files.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Advantages of this approach are simplicity and great point query performance. Even though multiple versions of data records exist, only the latest one is addressed by keydir. However, having to keep all keys in memory and rebuilding keydir on startup are limitations that might be a deal breaker for some use cases. While this approach is great for point queries, it does not offer any support for range queries.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>WiscKey <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#LU16">[LU16]</a> decouples sorting from garbage collection by keeping the keys sorted in LSM Trees, and keeping data records in unordered append-only files<a data-primary="vLogs (value logs)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887311704"/> called <em>vLogs</em> (value logs). This approach can solve two problems mentioned while discussing Bitcask: a need to keep all keys in memory and to rebuild a hashtable on startup.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#wisc_key_architecture">Figure 7-12</a> shows key components of WiscKey, and mapping between keys and log files. vLog files hold unordered data records. Keys are stored in sorted LSM Trees, pointing to the latest data records in the logfiles.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since keys are typically much smaller than the data records associated with them, compacting them is significantly more efficient. This approach can be particularly useful for use cases with a low rate of updates and deletes, where garbage collection won’t free up as much disk space.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The main challenge here is that because vLog data is unsorted, range scans require random I/O. WiscKey uses internal SSD parallelism to prefetch blocks in parallel during range scans and reduce random I/O costs. In terms of block transfers, the costs are still high: to fetch a single data record during the range scan, the entire page where it is located has to be read.</p>&#13;

</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During compaction, vLog file contents are read sequentially, merged, and written to a new location. Pointers (values in a key LSM Tree) are updated to point to these new locations. To avoid scanning entire vLog contents, WiscKey uses <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> pointers, holding information about vLog segments that hold live keys.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since data in vLog is unsorted and contains no liveness information, the key tree has to be scanned to find which values are still live. Performing these checks during garbage collection introduces additional complexity: traditional LSM Trees can resolve file contents during compaction without addressing the key index.<a data-primary="" data-startref="LSSunorder07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887303528"/></p>&#13;

<h1>Concurrency in LSM Trees</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The<a data-primary="log-structured merge-trees (LSM trees)" data-secondary="concurrency in LSM trees" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887300792"/><a data-primary="concurrency control" data-secondary="concurrency in LSM trees" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887296552"/><a data-primary="table views" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887295704"/> main concurrency challenges in LSM Trees are related to switching <em>table views</em> (collections of memory- and disk-resident tables that change during flush and compaction) and log synchronization. Memtables are also generally accessed concurrently (except core-partitioned stores such as ScyllaDB), but concurrent in-memory data structures are out of the scope of this book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">During flush, the following rules have to be followed:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The new memtable has to become available for reads and writes.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The old (flushing) memtable has to remain visible for reads.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The flushing memtable has to be written on disk.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Discarding a flushed memtable and making a flushed disk-resident table have to be performed as an atomic operation.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The write-ahead log segment, holding log entries of operations applied to the flushed memtable, has to be discarded.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For example, Apache Cassandra solves these problems by using <a href="https://databass.dev/links/84">operation order barriers</a>: all operations that were accepted for write will be waited upon prior to the memtable flush. This way the flush process (serving as a consumer) knows which other processes (acting as producers) depend on it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>More generally, we have the following synchronization points:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Memtable switch</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>After<a data-primary="memtable switch" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887283960"/> this, all writes go only to the new memtable, making it primary, while the old one is still available for reads.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Flush finalization</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="flush finalization" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887282072"/>Replaces the old memtable with a flushed disk-resident table in the table view.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Write-ahead log truncation</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="write-ahead log truncation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887280152"/>Discards a log segment holding records associated with a flushed memtable.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These operations have severe correctness implications. Continuing writes to the old memtable might result in data loss; for example, if the write is made into a memtable section that was already flushed. Similarly, failing to leave the old memtable available for reads until its disk-resident counterpart is ready will result in incomplete results.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During compaction, the table view is also changed, but here the process is slightly more straightforward: old disk-resident tables are discarded, and the compacted version is added instead. Old tables have to remain accessible for reads until the new one is fully written and is ready to replace them for reads. Situations in which the same tables participate in multiple compactions running in parallel have to be avoided as well.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In B-Trees, log truncation has to be coordinated with flushing dirty pages from the page cache to guarantee durability. In LSM Trees, we have a similar requirement: writes are buffered in a memtable, and their contents are not durable until fully flushed, so log truncation has to be coordinated with memtable flushes. As soon as the flush is complete, the log manager is given the information about the latest flushed log segment, and its contents can be safely discarded.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Not synchronizing log truncations with flushes will also result in data loss: if a log segment is discarded before the flush is complete, and the node crashes, log contents will not be replayed, and data from this segment won’t be restored.</p>&#13;

SSDs use log-structured storage, too, to deal with small random writes, minimize write overhead, improve wear leveling, and increase device lifetime.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Log-structured<a data-primary="disk-based data structures" data-secondary="solid state drives (SSDs)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887270488"/><a data-primary="solid state drives (SSDs)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887266984"/> storage (LSS) systems started gaining popularity around the time SSDs were becoming more affordable. LSM Trees and SSDs are a good match, since sequential workloads and append-only writes help to reduce amplification from in-place updates, which negatively affect performance on SSDs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If we stack multiple log-structured systems on top each other, we can run into several problems that we were trying to solve using LSS, including write amplification, fragmentation, and poor performance. At the very least, we need to keep the SSD flash translation layer and the filesystem in mind when developing our applications <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#YANG14">[YANG14]</a>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Flash Translation Layer" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="flash_translation_layer">&#13;
<h2>Flash Translation Layer</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Using<a data-primary="log stacking" data-secondary="Flash Translation Layer (FTL)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887264584"/><a data-primary="Flash Translation Layer (FTL)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887275672"/> a log-structuring mapping layer in SSDs is motivated by two factors: small random writes have to be batched together in a physical page, and the fact that SSDs work by using program/erase cycles. Writes can be done only into previously <em>erased</em> pages. This means that a page cannot be <em>programmed</em> (in other words, written) unless it is empty (in other words, was <em>erased</em>).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A <em>single</em> page cannot be erased, and only <em>groups</em> of pages in a <em>block</em>  (typically holding 64 to 512 pages) can be erased together. <a data-type="xref" href="#block_page_grouping">Figure 7-13</a> shows a schematic representation of pages, grouped into blocks. The flash translation layer (FTL) translates logical page addresses to their physical locations and keeps track of page states (live, discarded, or empty). When FTL runs out of free pages, it has to perform garbage collection and erase discarded pages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="block_page_grouping">&#13;
<img alt="dbin 0713" src="assets/dbin_0713.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-13. </span>SSD pages, grouped into blocks</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are no guarantees that all pages in the block that is about to be erased are discarded. Before the block can be erased, FTL has to relocate its <em>live</em> pages to one of the blocks containing empty pages. <a data-type="xref" href="#block_relocation">Figure 7-14</a> shows the process of moving live pages from one block to new locations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure class="width-75"><div class="figure" id="block_relocation">&#13;
<img alt="dbin 0714" src="assets/dbin_0714.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-14. </span>Page relocation during garbage collection</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When all live pages are relocated, the block can be safely erased, and its empty pages become available for writes. Since FTL is aware of page states and state transitions and has all the necessary information, it is also responsible for<a data-primary="wear leveling" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887252392"/> SSD <em>wear leveling</em>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>Wear leveling distributes the load evenly across the medium, avoiding hotspots, where blocks fail prematurely because of a high number of program-erase cycles. It is required, since flash memory cells can go through only a limited number of program-erase cycles, and using memory cells evenly helps to extend the lifetime of the device.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In summary, the motivation for using log-structured storage on SSDs is to amortize I/O costs by batching small random writes together, which generally results in a smaller number of operations and, subsequently, reduces the number of times the garbage collection is triggered.</p>&#13;

<h2>Filesystem Logging</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>On<a data-primary="log stacking" data-secondary="filesystem logging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887247608"/><a data-primary="filesystem logging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887246760"/> top of that, we get filesystems, many of which also use logging techniques for write buffering to reduce write amplification and use the underlying hardware <span class="keep-together">optimally.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Log stacking manifests in a few different ways. First, each layer has to perform its own bookkeeping, and most often the underlying log does not expose the information necessary to avoid duplicating the efforts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#higher_log_removal">Figure 7-15</a> shows a mapping between a higher-level log (for example, the application) and a lower-level log (for example, the filesystem) resulting in redundant logging and different garbage collection patterns <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#YANG14">[YANG14]</a>. Misaligned segment writes can make the situation even worse, since discarding a higher-level log segment may cause fragmentation and relocation of the neighboring segments’ parts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="higher_log_removal">&#13;
<img alt="dbin 0715" src="assets/dbin_0715.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-15. </span>Misaligned writes and discarding of a higher-level log segment</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Because layers do not communicate LSS-related scheduling (for example, discarding or relocating segments), lower-level subsystems might perform redundant operations on discarded data or the data that is about to be discarded. Similarly, because there’s no single, standard segment size, it may happen that unaligned higher-level segments occupy multiple lower-level segments. All these overheads can be reduced or completely avoided.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even though we say that log-structured storage is all about sequential I/O, we have to keep in mind that database systems may have multiple write streams (for example, log writes parallel to data record writes) <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#YANG14">[YANG14]</a>. When considered on a hardware level, interleaved sequential write streams may not translate into the same sequential pattern: blocks are not necessarily going to be placed in write order. <a data-type="xref" href="#overlapping_streams">Figure 7-16</a> shows multiple streams overlapping in time, writing records that have sizes not aligned with the underlying hardware page size.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="overlapping_streams">&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 7-16. </span>Unaligned multistream writes</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This results in <a data-primary="fragmentation" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887235144"/>fragmentation that we tried to avoid. To reduce interleaving, some database vendors recommend keeping the log on a separate device to isolate workloads and be able to reason about their performance and access patterns independently. However, it is more important to keep partitions aligned to the underlying hardware <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#INTEL14">[INTEL14]</a> and keep writes aligned to page size <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#KIM12">[KIM12]</a>.<a data-primary="" data-startref="LSSstack07" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887233128"/></p>&#13;

</blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#bw_tree">“Bw-Trees”</a>, we discussed<a data-primary="log-structured storage (LSS)" data-secondary="LLAMA and mindful stacking" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887223400"/><a data-primary="latch-free, log-structured, access-method aware (LLAMA)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887222552"/><a data-primary="mindful stacking" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887221944"/> an immutable B-Tree version called Bw-Tree. Bw-Tree is layered on top of a <em>latch-free, log-structured, access-method aware</em> (LLAMA) storage subsystem. This layering allows Bw-Trees to grow and shrink dynamically, while leaving garbage collection and page management transparent for the tree. Here, we’re most interested in the <em>access-method aware</em> part, demonstrating the benefits of coordination between the software layers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To recap, a <em>logical</em> Bw-Tree node consists of a linked list of <em>physical</em> delta nodes, a chain of updates from the newest one to the oldest one, ending in a base node. <span class="keep-together">Logical</span> nodes are linked using an in-memory mapping table, pointing to the location of the latest update on disk. Keys and values are added to and removed from the logical nodes, but their physical representations remain immutable.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Log-structured storage buffers node updates (delta nodes) together in 4 Mb flush buffers. As soon as the page fills up, it’s flushed on disk. Periodically, garbage collection reclaims space occupied by the unused delta and base nodes, and relocates the live ones to free up fragmented pages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Without access-method awareness, interleaved delta nodes that belong to different logical nodes will be written in their insertion order. Bw-Tree awareness in LLAMA allows for the consolidation of several delta nodes into a single contiguous physical location. If two updates in delta nodes <em>cancel</em> each other (for example, an insert followed by delete), their <em>logical</em> consolidation can be performed as well, and only the latter delete can be persisted.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>LSS garbage collection can also take care of consolidating the logical Bw-Tree node contents. This means that garbage collection will not only reclaim the free space, but also significantly reduce the physical node fragmentation. If garbage collection only rewrote several delta nodes contiguously, they would still take the same amount of space, and readers would need to perform the work of applying the delta updates to the base node. At the same time, if a higher-level system consolidated the nodes and wrote them contiguously to the new locations, LSS would <em>still</em> have to garbage-collect the old versions.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By being aware of Bw-Tree semantics, several deltas may be rewritten as a single base node with all deltas already applied <em>during</em> garbage collection. This reduces the total space used to represent this Bw-Tree node and the latency required to read the page while reclaiming the space occupied by discarded pages.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You can see that, when considered carefully, stacking can yield many benefits. It is not necessary to always build tightly coupled single-level structures. Good APIs and exposing the right information can significantly improve efficiency.</p>&#13;

<h2>Open-Channel SSDs</h2>&#13;

<p>An<a data-primary="Open-Channel SSDs" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887213528"/><a data-primary="disk-based data structures" data-secondary="solid state drives (SSDs)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887212920"/><a data-primary="solid state drives (SSDs)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887210712"/> alternative to stacking software layers is to skip all indirection layers and use the hardware directly. For example, it is possible to avoid using a filesystem and flash translation layer by developing for Open-Channel SSDs. This way, we can avoid at least two layers of logs and have more control over wear-leveling, garbage collection, data placement, and scheduling. One of the implementations that uses this approach is LOCS (LSM Tree-based KV Store on Open-Channel SSD) <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#WANG13">[WANG13]</a>. Another example using Open-Channel SSDs is LightNVM, implemented in the Linux kernel <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#BJØRLING17">[BJØRLING17]</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The flash translation layer usually handles data placement, garbage collection, and page relocation. Open-Channel SSDs expose their internals, drive management, and I/O scheduling without needing to go through the FTL. While this certainly requires much more attention to detail from the developer’s perspective, this approach may yield significant performance improvements. You can draw a parallel with using the <code>O_DIRECT</code> flag to bypass the kernel page cache, which gives better control, but requires manual page management.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Software Defined Flash (SDF) <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#OUYANG14">[OUYANG14]</a>, a<a data-primary="Software Defined Flash (SDF)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466887206696"/> hardware/software codesigned Open-Channel SSDs system, exposes an asymmetric I/O interface that takes SSD specifics into consideration. Sizes of read and write units are different, and write unit size corresponds to erase unit size (block), which greatly reduces write amplification. This setting is ideal for log-structured storage, since there’s only one software layer that performs garbage collection and relocates pages. Additionally, developers have access to internal SSD parallelism, since every channel in SDF is exposed as a separate block device, which can be used to further improve performance.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Hiding complexity behind a simple API might sound compelling, but can cause complications in cases in which software layers have different semantics. Exposing <em>some</em> underlying system internals may be beneficial for better integration.</p>&#13;

<h1>Summary</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Log-structured storage</em> is used everywhere: from the flash translation layer, to filesystems and database systems. It helps to reduce write amplification by batching small random writes together in memory. To reclaim space occupied by removed segments, LSS periodically triggers garbage collection.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>LSM Trees</em> take some ideas from LSS and help to build index structures managed in a log-structured manner: writes are batched in memory and flushed on disk; shadowed data records are cleaned up during compaction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It is important to remember that many software layers use LSS, and make sure that layers are stacked optimally. Alternatively, we can skip the filesystem level altogether and access hardware directly.</p>&#13;
