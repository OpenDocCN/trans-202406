<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="maintenance" id="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc0"/>You launched the site!  Congratulations, now you never have to think about it again.  What’s that?  You <em>do</em> have to keep thinking about it?  Well, in that case, keep reading.</p>

<p>Although it has happened a couple of times in my career, it has been the exception to the rule that you finish a site and then never have to touch it again (and when it does happen, it’s usually because someone else is doing the work, not that work doesn’t need to be done).  I distinctly remember one website launch “postmortem.”  I piped up and said, “Shouldn’t we really call it a <em>postpartum</em>?”<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45053572094072-marker" href="ch22.xhtml#idm45053572094072">1</a></sup>  Launching a website really is more of a birth than a death.  Once it launches, you’re glued to the analytics, anxiously awaiting the client’s reaction, waking up at three in the morning to check to see if the site is still up. It’s your baby.</p>

<p>Scoping a website, designing a website, building a website: these are all activities that can be planned to death.  But what usually receives short shrift is <em>planning the maintenance</em> of a website.  This chapter will give you some advice on navigating those waters.</p>

<h2>Have a Longevity Plan</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="maintenance" data-secondary="principles of" id="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc1"/>It <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="longevity plan" id="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc2"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="maintenance" data-secondary="longevity plan and" id="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc3"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="websites" data-secondary="longevity plan for" id="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc4"/>always surprises me when a client agrees on a price to build a website, but it’s never discussed how long the site is expected to last.  My experience is that if you do good work, clients are happy to pay for it.  What clients do <em>not</em> appreciate is the unexpected: being told after three years that their site has to be rebuilt when they had an unspoken expectation that it would last five.</p>

<p>The internet moves fast.  If you built a website with the absolute best and newest technology you could find, it might feel like a creaky relic in two short years.  Or it could truck along for seven, aging, but doing so gracefully (this is a lot less common!).</p>

<p>Setting expectations about website longevity is part art, part salesmanship, and part science.  The science of it involves something that all scientists, but very few web developers, do: keep records.  Imagine if you had a record of every website your team had ever launched, the history of maintenance requests and failures, the technologies used, and how long before each site was rebuilt. There are many variables, obviously, from the team members involved, to the economy, to the shifting winds of technology, but that doesn’t mean that meaningful trends can’t be discovered in the data.  You may find that certain development approaches work better for your team, or certain platforms or technologies.  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="procrastination" id="idm45053572080584"/>What I almost guarantee you will find is a correlation between “procrastination” and defects: the longer you put off an infrastructure update or platform upgrade that’s causing pain, the worse it will be. Having a good issue-tracking system and keeping meticulous records will allow you to give your client a much better (and more realistic) picture of what the life cycle of their project is going to be.</p>

<p>The salesmanship of it boils down to money, of course.  If a client can afford to have their website completely rebuilt every three years, then they won’t be very likely to suffer from aging infrastructure (they will have other problems, though).  On the flip side, there will be clients who need their dollar to stretch as far as possible, wanting a website that will last for five or even seven years. (I’ve known websites that have dragged on for even longer than that, but I feel that seven years is the maximum realistic life expectancy for websites that have any hope of continuing to be useful.)  You have a responsibility to both of these clients, and both come with their own challenges.  With the clients who have a lot of money, don’t just take their money because they have it: use that extra money to give them something extraordinary.  With the clients on a tight budget, you will have to find creative ways to design their website for greater longevity in the face of constantly changing technology.  Both of these extremes have their own challenges, but ones that can be solved.  What’s important, though is that you <em>know</em> what the expectations are.</p>

<p>Lastly, there’s the art of the matter.  This is what ties it all together: understanding what the client can afford, and where you can honestly convince the client to spend more money so they get value where they need it.  It is also the art of understanding technology futures, and being able to predict what technologies will be painfully obsolete in five years and which will be going strong.</p>

<p>There’s no way to predict anything with absolute certainty, of course.  You could bet wrong on technologies, personnel shifts can completely change the technical culture of your organization, and technology vendors can go out of business (though this is usually less of a problem in the open source world).  The technology that you thought would be solid for the lifetime of your product may turn out to be a fad, and you’ll find yourself facing the decision to rebuild sooner than you expected.  On the flip side, sometimes the exactly right team comes together at the exact right time with the exact right technology, and something is created that far outlives any reasonable expectations.  None of this uncertainty should deter you from having a plan, however: better to have a plan that goes awry than to always be rudderless.</p>

<p>It should be clear to you by now that I feel that JavaScript and Node are technologies that are going to be around for a while.  The Node community is vibrant and enthusiastic, and wisely based on a language that has clearly <em>won</em>.  Most important, perhaps, is that JavaScript is a multiparadigm language: object-oriented, functional, procedural, synchronous, asynchronous—it’s all there.  This makes JavaScript an inviting platform for developers from many different backgrounds, and is in large part responsible for the pace of innovation in the JavaScript ecosystem.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc4" id="idm45053572073848"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc3" id="idm45053572073080"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc2" id="idm45053572072392"/></p>

Why are you using source control?  Understand the reasons, and make sure the tools are supporting those reasons.  There are many reasons to use source control, but the one that always seems to me to have the biggest payoff is attribution: knowing exactly what change was made when and who did it, so I can ask for more information if necessary.  Version control is one of our greatest tools for understanding the history of our projects and how we work together as a team.</p>

Without a systematic way to record the history of a project, no insight is possible.  You’ve probably heard it said that the definition of insanity is “doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results” (often dubiously attributed to Albert Einstein).  It does seem crazy to repeat your mistakes over and over again, but how can you avoid it if you don’t know what mistakes you’re making?</p>

<p>Record everything: every defect the client reports; every defect you find before the client sees it; every complaint, every question, every bit of praise.  Record how long it took, who fixed it, what Git commits were involved, and who approved the fix.  The art here is finding tools that don’t make this overly time-consuming or onerous.  A bad issue-tracking system will languish, unused, and it will be worse than useless.  A good issue-tracking system will yield vital insights into your business, your team, and your clients.</p>

The tools you use are useful only if you use them, and use them correctly.  Code reviews are a great way to encourage hygiene because <em>everything</em> can be touched on, from discussing the use of the issue-tracking system in which the request originated to the tests that had to be added to verify the fix to the version control commit comments.</p>

<p>The data you collect from your issue-tracking system should be reviewed on a periodic basis and discussed with the team.  From this data, you can gain insights about what’s working and what’s not.  You might be surprised by what you find.</p>

Usually it’s something that doesn’t seem so bad: you notice that your team is routinely eating up a lot of hours on a weekly update that could be drastically improved by a little refactoring.  Every week that you delay refactoring is another week you’re paying the inefficiency cost.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45053572053096-marker" href="ch22.xhtml#idm45053572053096">2</a></sup> Worse, some costs may increase over time.</p>

<p>A great example of this is failing to update software dependencies.  As the software ages, and team members change, it’s harder to find people who remember (or ever understood) the creaky old software.  The support community starts to evaporate, and before long, the technology is deprecated and you can’t get any kind of support for it.  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="technical debt" id="idm45053572050696"/>You often hear this described as <em>technical debt</em>, and it’s a very real thing.  While you should avoid procrastinating, understanding the website longevity can factor into these decisions: if you’re just about to redesign the whole website, there’s little value in eliminating technical debt that’s been building up.</p>

That check should include a link checker, HTML and CSS validation, and running your tests.  The key here is <em>documented</em>: if the items that compose the QA check aren’t documented, you will inevitably miss things.  A documented QA checklist for each site not only helps prevent overlooked checks, but also allows new team members to be effective immediately.  Ideally, the QA checklist can be executed by a nontechnical team member.  This will give your (possibly) nontechnical manager confidence in your team and will allow you to spread QA responsibilities around if you don’t have a dedicated QA department.  Depending on your relationship with your client, you may also want to share your QA checklist (or part of it) with the client; it’s a good way to remind them what they’re paying for, and that you are looking out for their best interests.</p>

They are easy to set up, and they give you a very important view of your site: how the major search engines see it.

<p>Often, you will be able to spot subtle UX issues by keeping an eye on your analytics.  Are there certain pages that are not getting the traffic that you expect?  That could indicate a problem with your navigation or promotions, or an SEO issue.  Are your bounce rates high?  That could indicate the content on your pages needs some tailoring (people are getting to your site by searching, but when they arrive on your site, they realize it’s not what they’re looking for).  You should have an analytics checklist to go along with your QA checklist (it could even be part of your QA checklist).  That checklist should be a “living document,” because over the lifetime of your website, you or your client may have shifting priorities about what content is most important.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Prioritize Lead Tracking"><div class="sect2" id="idm45053572024632">
<h2>Prioritize Lead Tracking</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lead tracking" id="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc5"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="maintenance" data-secondary="lead tracking" id="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc6"/>In the internet world, the strongest signal your visitors can give you to indicate interest in your product or service is contact information. You should treat this information with the utmost care.  Any form that collects an email or phone number should be tested routinely as part of your QA checklist, and there should <em>always</em> be redundancy when you collect that information.  The worst thing you can do to a potential customer is collect contact information and then lose it.</p>

<p>Because lead tracking is so critical to the success of your website, I recommend these five principles for collecting information:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Have a fallback in case JavaScript fails</dt>
<dd>
<p>Collecting customer information via Ajax is fine—it often results in a better user experience.  However, if JavaScript should fail for any reason (the user could disable it, or a script on your website could have an error, preventing your Ajax from functioning correctly), the form submission should work anyway.  A great way to test this is to disable JavaScript and use your form.  It’s okay if the user experience is not ideal: the point is that user data is not lost.  To implement this, <em>always</em> have a valid and working <code>action</code> parameter in your <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag, even if you normally <span class="keep-together">use Ajax.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt>If you use Ajax, get the URL from the form’s <code>action</code> parameter</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Ajax" data-secondary="action parameter" id="idm45053572013640"/>While not strictly necessary, this helps prevent you from accidentally forgetting the <code>action</code> parameter on your <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags.  If you tie your Ajax to successful no-JavaScript submission, it’s much harder to lose customer data.  For example, your form tag could be <code>&lt;form action="/submit/email" method="POST"&gt;</code>; then in your Ajax code, you would get the <code>action</code> for the form from the DOM, and use that in your Ajax submission code.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Provide at least one level of redundancy</dt>
<dd>
<p>You’ll probably want to save leads to a database or an external service such as Campaign Monitor.  But what if your database fails, or Campaign Monitor goes down, or there’s a network issue?  You still don’t want to lose that lead.  A common way to provide redundancy is to send an email in addition to storing the lead.  If you take this approach, you should not use a person’s email address, but a shared email address (such as <em>dev@meadowlarktravel.com</em>): the redundancy does no good if you send it to a person and that person leaves the organization.  You could also store the lead in a backup database, or even a CSV file.  However, <em>whenever</em> your primary storage fails, there should be some mechanism to alert you of the failure.  Collecting a redundant backup is the first half of the battle; being aware of failures and taking appropriate action is the second half.</p>
</dd>
<dt>In case of total storage failure, inform the user</dt>
<dd>
<p>Let’s say you have three levels of redundancy: your primary storage is Campaign Monitor, and if that fails, you back up to a CSV file and send an email to <em>dev@meadowlarktravel.com</em>.  If <em>all</em> of these channels fail, the user should receive a message that says something like, “We’re sorry, we’re experiencing technical difficulties.  Please try again later, or contact <em>support@meadowlarktravel.com</em>.”</p>
</dd>
<dt>Check for positive confirmation, not absence of an error</dt>
<dd>
<p>It’s quite common to have your Ajax handler return an object with an <code>err</code> property in the case of failure; the client code then has something that looks like this: <code>if(data.err){ /* inform user of failure */ } else { /* thank user for successful submission */ }</code>.  Avoid this approach.  There’s nothing wrong with setting an <code>err</code> property, but if there’s an error in your Ajax handler, leading the server to respond with a 500 response code or a response that isn’t valid JSON, <em>this approach could fail silently</em>.  The user’s lead will disappear into the void, and they will be none the wiser.  Instead, provide a <code>success</code> property for successful submission (even if the primary storage failed: if the user’s information was recorded by <em>something</em>, you may return <code>success</code>).  Then your client-side code becomes <code>if(data.success){ /* thank user for successful submission */ } else { /* inform user of failure \*/ }</code>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc6" id="idm45053571998440"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc5" id="idm45053571997672"/></p>

Whether it is a logfile, a table in a database, a client-side console log, or an email that goes to a dead address, the end result is the same: <em>your website has quality problems that are going unnoticed</em>.</p>

<p>The number one defense you can have against this problem is to <em>provide an easy, standard method for logging errors</em>.  Document it.  Don’t make it difficult.  Don’t make it obscure.  Make sure every developer that touches your project is aware of it.  It can be as simple as exposing a <code>meadowlarkLog</code> function (<code>log</code> is often used by other packages).  It doesn’t matter if the function is recording to a database, flat file, email, or some combination thereof: the important thing is that it is standard.  It also allows you to improve your logging mechanism (for example, flat files are less useful when you scale out your server, so you would modify your <code>meadowlarkLog</code> function to record to a database instead).  Once you have the logging mechanism in place, documented, and everyone on your team knows about it, add “check logs” to your QA checklist, and have instructions on how to do that.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-22-maintenance-asciidoc1" id="idm45053571989576"/></p>

Usually it’s just small things: tidbits that feel easier to just rewrite than to dig up in some project that you did months ago.  All of those little rewritten snippets add up.  Worse, it flies in the face of good QA: you’re probably not going to go to the trouble to write tests for all these little snippets (and if you do, you’re doubling the time that you’re wasting by not reusing existing code).  Each snippet—doing the same thing—can have different bugs.  It’s a bad habit.</p>

<p>Development in Node and Express offers some great ways to combat this problem.  Node brought namespacing (via modules) and packages (via npm), and Express brings the concept of middleware.  With these tools at your disposal, developing reusable code is a lot easier.</p>

<h2>Private npm Registry</h2>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="npm (package manager)" data-secondary="private registries" id="idm45053571982472"/>npm registries are a great place to store shared code; it’s what npm was designed for, after all.  In addition to simple storage, you get versioning, and a convenient way to include those packages in other projects.</p>

<p>There’s a fly in the ointment, though: unless you’re working in a completely open source organization, you may not want to create npm packages for all of your reusable code.  (There can be other reasons than intellectual property protection, too: your packages could be so organization- or project-specific that it doesn’t make sense to make them available on a public registry.)</p>

<p>One way to handle this is <em>private npm registries</em>.  npm now offers Orgs, which allows you to publish private packages and give your developers paid logins, allowing them to access those private packages.  See <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/products">npm</a> for more information about npm Orgs and private packages.</p>

The next step, then, is to put reusable middleware in a package and put it in an npm registry.</p>

<p>If you find that your middleware is too project-specific to put in a reusable package, you should consider refactoring the middleware to be configured for more general use.  Remember that you can pass configuration objects into middleware to make them useful in a whole range of situations.  Here is an overview of the most common ways to expose middleware in a Node module.  All of the following assume that you’re using these modules as a package, and that package is called <code>meadowlark-stuff</code>.</p>
