- en: Design patterns make it easy for us to build on the shoulders of developers
    who have defined solutions to challenging problems and architectures over several
    decades. The contents of this book should provide sufficient information to get
    you started using the patterns we covered in your scripts, plug-ins, and web applications.

- en: We need to be aware of these patterns, but it’s also essential to know how and
    when to use them. Study the pros and cons of each pattern before employing them.
    Take the time to experiment with patterns to fully appreciate what they offer
    and make usage judgments based on a pattern’s actual value to your application.
