As your organization ramps up on the number of applications, managing the Kubernetes clusters becomes a full-time job. That’s the role of a Kubernetes administrator. The person responsible for this job ensures that each cluster is an operational state, scales up the cluster by onboarding nodes, upgrades the Kubernetes version of the nodes to incorporate patches and new features, and is in charge of a backup strategy for crucial cluster data. To help job seekers and employers have a standard means to demonstrate and evaluate proficiency in developing with a Kubernetes environment, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) developed the <a href="https://oreil.ly/Ds8nq">Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)</a> program. To achieve this certification, you need to pass an exam.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="certifications for" id="idm45322734266528"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)" id="idm45322734246224"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)" id="idm45322734245408"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)" id="idm45322734233072"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="certifications" id="idm45322734421168"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)" id="idm45322734420384"/>There are two other Kubernetes certifications you can find on the CNCF web page. The <a href="https://oreil.ly/RxHwQ">Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)</a> focuses on the developer-centric application of Kubernetes. The <a href="https://oreil.ly/53csH">Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)</a> was created to verify the competence on security-based topics and requires a successful pass of the CKA exam before you can register. Passing the CKAD and CKS are not mandatory for taking the CKA exam.</p>

<p>In this study guide, I will explore the topics covered in the CKA exam to fully prepare you to pass the certification exam. We’ll look at determining when and how you should apply the core concepts of Kubernetes to manage an application. We’ll also examine the <code>kubectl</code> command-line tool, a mainstay of the Kubernetes engineer. I will also offer tips to help you better prepare for the exam and share my personal experience with getting ready for all aspects of it.</p>

<p>The CKA is different from the typical multiple-choice format of other certifications. It’s completely performance based and requires you to demonstrate deep knowledge of the tasks at hand under immense time pressure. Are you ready to pass the test on the first go?</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who This Book Is For"><div class="sect1" id="idm45322731117152">
<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p>The primary target group for this book is administrators who want to prepare for the CKA exam. The “exam details and resources” content covers all aspects of the exam curriculum, though basic knowledge of the Kubernetes architecture and its concepts is expected. If you are completely new to Kubernetes, I recommend reading <a href="https://oreil.ly/KSPkv" class="orm:hideurl"><em>Kubernetes Up &amp; Running</em></a> by Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, and Lachlan Evenson (O’Reilly) or <em>Kubernetes in Action</em> by Marko Lukša (Manning Publications) first.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What You Will Learn"><div class="sect1" id="idm45322734234560">
<h1>What You Will Learn</h1>

<p>The content of the book condenses the most important aspects relevant to the CKA exam. Cloud-provider-specific Kubernetes implementations like AKS or GKE do not need to be considered. Given the plethora of configuration options available in Kubernetes, it’s almost impossible to cover all use cases and scenarios without duplicating the official documentation. Test takers are encouraged to reference the <a href="https://oreil.ly/MoLjc">Kubernetes documentation</a> as the go-to compendium for broader exposure.</p>

<p>The outline of the book follows the CKA curriculum to a T. While there might be a more natural, didactical structure for learning Kubernetes in general, the curriculum outline will help test takers prepare for the exam by focusing on specific topics. As a result, you will find yourself cross-referencing other chapters of the book depending on your existing knowledge level.</p>

<p>Be aware that this book covers only the concepts relevant to the CKA exam. Certain primitives that you may expect to be covered by the certification curriculum—for example, the API primitive Ingress—are not discussed. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation or other books if you want to dive deeper.</p>

<p>Practical experience with Kubernetes is key to passing the exam. Each chapter contains a section named “Sample Exercises” with practice questions. Solutions to those questions can be found in the <a data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#appendix-a">Appendix</a>.</p>
