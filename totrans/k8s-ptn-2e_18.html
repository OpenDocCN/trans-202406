<div class="partintro">&#13;
<p>Container images and containers are similar to classes and objects in the object-oriented world. Container images are the blueprint from which containers are instantiated. But these containers do not run in isolation; they run in other abstractions called Pods, where they interact with other containers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The patterns in this category are focused on structuring and organizing containers in a Pod to satisfy different use cases. Pods provide unique runtime capabilities. The forces that affect containers in Pods result in the patterns discussed in the following chapters:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch15.html#InitContainer">Chapter 15, “Init Container”</a>, introduces a lifecycle for initialization-related tasks, decoupled from the main application responsibilities.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch16.html#Sidecar">Chapter 16, “Sidecar”</a>, describes how to extend and enhance the functionality of a preexisting container without changing it.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch17.html#Adapter">Chapter 17, “Adapter”</a>, takes a heterogeneous system and makes it conform to a consistent unified interface that can be consumed by the outside world.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
