Attendance at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon conferences is experiencing an explosive level of growth. In addition, the Kubernetes open source community of contributors continues to expand and strengthen. The number of industries that are adopting Kubernetes is astounding.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch09.html#ch01fn40" id="ch01fn40-marker">1</a></sup> Similarly, OpenShift has seen its customer base grow from 1,000 to 1,700 in the past year and has also seen strong adoption among Fortune 2000 companies.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch09.html#ch01fn41" id="ch01fn41-marker">2</a></sup> In this chapter, we make some predictions about what the future holds for both traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift. We discuss our expectations for how these technologies will grow and increase their impact across numerous facets of cloud native computing, including legacy application migration, high performance computing, machine learning and deep learning applications, open source marketplaces, and multicloud environments. We then conclude this chapter with a discussion of recommended resources for further study.</p>&#13;

<h1>Increased Migration of Legacy Enterprise Applications to Cloud Native Applications</h1>&#13;
<p>Over the years, both traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift have made <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="migration of legacy applications" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188928056"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenShift (Red Hat)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="migration of legacy applications" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188926312"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="future of Kubernetes and OpenShift" data-secondary="migration of legacy applications" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188924648"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="applications" data-secondary="migration of legacy applications" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188923240"/>dramatic improvements that will result in accelerating the migration of legacy enterprise applications to cloud native applications. With the introduction of the operator framework, these platforms are now much more capable of supporting stateful applications, as well as managing the complete software management life cycle for these applications. Additionally, as mentioned earlier in this book, the OpenShift platform continues to innovate in areas of tooling that reduce the complexity of moving from source code to having a fully functional containerized cloud native application. At the same time, Kubernetes and OpenShift are greatly increasing the types of applications they can support by leveraging new <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Knative" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188920984"/>projects like Knative to support serverless and function-based programming models. The convergence of all these innovations makes traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift in particular well-suited to support an even greater domain of enterprise applications. Thus, we anticipate that in the near future there will be a dramatic acceleration in the migration of legacy enterprise applications to cloud native applications that run on traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift. Furthermore, we anticipate even greater interoperability and integration will occur between traditional mainframe applications and cloud native applications. In fact, there is already some early experimental work demonstrating that <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="COBOL applications containerized" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188919032"/>COBOL applications can be containerized and run on both Kubernetes and OpenShift.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch09.html#ch01fn43" id="ch01fn43-marker">3</a></sup></p>&#13;

<h1>Increased Adoption of Kubernetes for High Performance Computing</h1>&#13;
<p>There is a long, rich history of using server clusters for supporting high <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="high performance computing initiatives" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188912392"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenShift (Red Hat)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="high performance computing initiatives" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188910728"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="future of Kubernetes and OpenShift" data-secondary="high performance computing initiatives" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188909064"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="high performance computing initiatives" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188907656"/>performance computing initiatives. Pioneering work in this space began in the late 1980s with platforms like the Parallel Virtual Machine.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch09.html#ch01fn44" id="ch01fn44-marker">4</a></sup> Over the years, the high performance computing community has embraced new technologies that improve efficiency and scalability. Kubernetes and its container-based approach provide several benefits that make the environment well-suited for high performance computing applications. Because Kubernetes is container based, the platform experiences less overhead to start up new tasks, and the tasks can be of a finer grain operation than those supported by VM-based cloud computing environments. The reduction of latency associated with the creation and destruction of computational tasks that occur when using containers instead of VMs improves the scalability of a high performance computing environment. Furthermore, the increased efficiency that is possible by packing a larger number of containers onto a physical server in contrast to the limited number of VMs that can be placed on a physical server is another critical advantage for high performance applications.</p>&#13;
<p>In addition to reduced latency, Kubernetes environments support a parallel work queue model. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="work queue model" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188903064"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="work queue model of Kubernetes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188901720"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes Up and Running (Burns, Beda, and Hightower)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188900744"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Burns, Brendan" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188899608"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Beda, Joe" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188898504"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Hightower, Kelsey" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188897400"/>An excellent overview of the Kubernetes work queue model can be found in <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/e6rve"><em>Kubernetes Up and Running</em></a> (O’Reilly). The work queue model described in this book is essentially the “bag of tasks” parallel computing model. Research has shown that this parallel computing model is a superior approach for the execution of high performance parallel applications in a cluster environment.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch09.html#ch01fn45" id="ch01fn45-marker">5</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>Even though the Kubernetes project has matured substantially since its inception, it continues to innovate in ways that improve its ability to efficiently run workloads. Most recently, Kubernetes made significant advances to its workload-scheduling algorithms that enable it to achieve better cluster utilization and high availability for its workloads.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch09.html#ch01fn46" id="ch01fn46-marker">6</a></sup> The efforts the Kubernetes SIG Scheduler <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="Scheduler" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188890200"/>team has made over the years has culminated in Kubernetes being a platform that is incredibly flexible and efficient in how it schedules workloads for a variety of custom application needs.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch09.html#ch01fn47" id="ch01fn47-marker">7</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>Because of all these factors, as well as the large number of cloud computing environments that offer Kubernetes-based environments, we expect huge growth in adoption of Kubernetes by the high performance computing community.</p>&#13;

<h1>Kubernetes and OpenShift Will Become the De Facto Platforms for Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h1>&#13;
<p>Machine learning and deep learning applications typically require highly <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="machine learning and deep learning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188884152"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenShift (Red Hat)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="machine learning and deep learning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188882536"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="future of Kubernetes and OpenShift" data-secondary="machine learning and deep learning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188880920"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="machine learning platform" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188879512"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="deep learning platform" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188878392"/>scalable environments. Data scientists with expertise in these domains want easy-to-use platforms that enable their applications to run in production at scale. Similar to our justification provided for adopting Kubernetes for high performance computing, we anticipate that machine learning and deep learning environments will greatly benefit from adopting Kubernetes-based environments as their primary platforms. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubeflow initiative" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188876728"/>In fact, initiatives like <a href="https://oreil.ly/NjZxV">Kubeflow</a>, which are focused on providing an open source Kubernetes-based platform for machine learning applications, are already attracting a significant number of contributors to their open source projects.</p>&#13;

<h1>Open Cloud Marketplaces Will Accelerate Adoption of Cloud Native Applications</h1>&#13;
<p>An increasing number of enterprises are beginning to use both multiple <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="cloud native application adoption" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188872712"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenShift (Red Hat)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="cloud native application adoption" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188870968"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="future of Kubernetes and OpenShift" data-secondary="cloud native application adoption" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188869304"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud native applications" data-secondary="adoption accelerating" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188867896"/>public clouds and private datacenters hosting their on-premises clouds. These enterprises are quickly realizing that they need an easy way to purchase, deploy, and manage cloud native application software that runs across all these environments. To address this situation, open cloud marketplaces are emerging. In these marketplaces, cloud native applications are packaged up using the Kubernetes operator packaging model. This approach enables the open cloud marketplace to automatically install, deploy, update, scale, and back up cloud native applications.</p>&#13;
<p>A recent example of an open cloud marketplace is <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Red Hat Marketplace" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188865384"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cloud native applications" data-secondary="Red Hat Marketplace" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188864280"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="future of Kubernetes and OpenShift" data-secondary="cloud native application adoption" data-tertiary="Red Hat Marketplace" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188862888"/>the <a href="https://oreil.ly/oE1vW">Red Hat Marketplace</a>, which enables customers to purchase cloud native application software that works across all major cloud environments as well as on-premises clouds. The Red Hat Marketplace provides certification, vulnerability scans, and support for the cloud native application software no matter which cloud you choose to deploy it on. <a data-type="xref" href="#red_hat_marketplace">Figure 9-1</a> is a snapshot of the home page for the Red Hat Marketplace.</p>&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="red_hat_marketplace">&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 9-1. </span>Red Hat <a href="https://oreil.ly/oE1vW">Marketplace</a></h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before less_space">Because the software on Red Hat Marketplace is vetted and certified, it provides developers with a curated view of the best tools and software stacks for building enterprise solutions to run on Red Hat OpenShift. This allows developers to focus on the capabilities the software provides, not on whether it’s suitable for the environment in which they’ll run it.</p>&#13;
<p>Because developers may begin a new development project only a few times a year, they have few opportunities to select an application stack and associated tooling. An open cloud marketplace like Red Hat Marketplace enables developers to try their desired software for free and progress seamlessly to a commercially supported version when they are ready. In addition, Red Hat Marketplace can provide visibility to development managers into how much consumption of deploying applications to each cloud is occurring. This lets them see how utilization is occurring across each platform and enables them to better manage development costs.</p>&#13;

<h1>OpenShift Will Be the Platform for Enterprise Multicloud</h1>&#13;
<p>After reading this book, this last prediction should come as no surprise to you. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="multicloud management" data-secondary="OpenShift" data-tertiary="platform of choice" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188852568"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="OpenShift as multicloud platform" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188850824"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenShift (Red Hat)" data-secondary="future of" data-tertiary="multicloud platform of choice" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188849208"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="future of Kubernetes and OpenShift" data-secondary="OpenShift as multicloud platform" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188847544"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Istio service mesh project" data-secondary="OpenShift leveraging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188846136"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenShift (Red Hat)" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="popularity of distribution" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358188844744"/>OpenShift has proven that it provides superior interoperability and workload portability and is available from all major cloud providers, including IBM Cloud, Google Cloud, Amazon Cloud, Azure, and many others. In addition, OpenShift leverages the Istio Service Mesh, and this critical networking technology reduces the complexity of connecting applications that reside in different clouds. It also has built-in tools specifically tailored for managing multicloud clusters. For all these reasons we fully expect OpenShift to be the preferred platform for enterprise multicloud activities. In fact, many enterprise customers that use OpenShift have already embraced the use of multiple clusters, and these clusters are deployed across multiple clouds or in multiple datacenters. This behavior can result from several factors. First, an enterprise might inherit applications that run on a different cloud due to an acquisition. Second, different clouds may offer different services, and the enterprise may require a best-of-breed solution that encompasses the use of a multicloud solution. Third, data locality constraints can serve as an anchor for critical applications on certain clouds or perhaps on a premises cloud. For all these reasons, OpenShift is well positioned to be the ideal platform for enterprise multicloud applications.</p>&#13;

<h1>Summary</h1>&#13;
<p>In this book, we have covered a broad array of topics to help you successfully run both Kubernetes and OpenShift in production. We provided a historical overview of traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift and discussed the key benefits of both platforms that have driven the huge growth in their popularity. We described the architecture for both environments and important Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. We then began a journey into foundational production-related topics, such as advanced resource management, single cluster high availability, and continuous delivery. Next, we explored the more advanced topic of multicluster utilization with a focus on multicluster provisioning, upgrading, and policy support. We then looked at a working example of multicluster application delivery. Finally, we ended with a short discussion on what the future holds for Kubernetes and OpenShift, and we presented several recommended resources for further study.
