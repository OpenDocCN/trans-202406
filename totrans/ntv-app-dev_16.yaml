- en: In the second half of the book, starting here, we create functional apps in
    both platforms using the tasks from [PartÂ I](part01.html#part_1_tasks). Here,
    you get to see the theoretical code from Part I used in a practical fashion.

    this book is mainly a cross-reference. We may choose to follow more generic patterns
    than is common in one platform or the other in order to demonstrate the similarity.
    We are not maintaining that the apps presented here are necessarily the most efficiently
    or effectively programmed, but we do hope that they demonstrate the common practices
    we want to emphasize with this work.
