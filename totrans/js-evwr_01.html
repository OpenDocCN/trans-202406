<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>The idea for this book came to me after writing my first Electron desktop application. Having made a career as a web developer, I was immediately smitten with the possibilities of using web technologies to build cross-platform applications. At the same time, React, React Native, and GraphQL were all taking off. I sought out resources to learn how all of these things fit together, but kept coming up short. This book represents the guide that I wished I had.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The ultimate goal of this book is to introduce the possibilities of using a single programming language, JavaScript, to build all sorts of applications.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thanks to all of the wonderful people at O’Reilly, past and present, who have been universally welcoming and open to my ideas over the years. I want to particularly thank my editor, Angela Rufino, who has given me feedback, encouragement, and lots of helpful reminders. I want to also thank Mike Loukides, who has provided me with both caffeine and great conversation. Lastly, thanks to Jennifer Pollock, for her support and encouragement.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I am eternally grateful for the open source community, from which I have learned and benefited. Without the individuals and organizations who have created and maintained the many libraries I have written about, this book would not be possible.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Several technical reviewers helped make this book better, ensuring that things were accurate. Thank you, Andy Ngom, Brian Sletten, Maximiliano Firtman, and Zeeshan Chawdhary. It’s a heck of a code review to undertake and I sincerely appreciate their efforts. Special thanks goes to my long-time colleague and friend, Jimmy Wilson, who I called in at the 11th hour to review and provide feedback. It was a lot to ask, but as with everything he does, he took it on with gusto. This book wouldn’t be what it is without his help.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ve been incredibly lucky to surround myself with smart, passionate, supportive co-workers throughout my adult life. So many lessons big and small, both technical and nontechnical, have come through my time with them. The full list is too long for print, but I want to give a shout-out to Elizabeth Bond, John Paul Doguin, Marc Esher, Jenn Lassiter, and Jessica Schafer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Music was my constant companion as I wrote, and this book may not exist without the wonderful sounds of Chuck Johnson, Mary Lattimore, Makaya McCraven, G.S. Schray, Sam Wilkes, Hiroshi Yoshimura, and many others.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, I want to thank my wife, Abbey, and my children, Riley, Harrison, and Harlow, with whom I sacrificed a lot of time to write this book. Thank you for putting up with me while I was locked away in my office—or when I wasn’t, but my mind still was. The four of you are the motivation for everything that I do.</p>&#13;
