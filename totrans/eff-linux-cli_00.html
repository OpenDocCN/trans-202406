<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>This book will take your Linux command-line skills to the next level
so you can work faster, smarter, and more efficiently.</p>

<p>If you’re like most Linux users, you learned your early command-line
skills on the job, or by reading an intro book, or by installing Linux
at home and just trying things out. I’ve written this book to help you
take the next step—to build intermediate to advanced skills at the
Linux command line. It’s filled with techniques and concepts that I
hope will transform how you interact with Linux and boost your
productivity.  Think of it as a second book on Linux use that takes
you beyond the basics.</p>

<p>A command line is the simplest of interfaces, yet also the most
challenging. It’s simple because you’re presented with nothing but a
prompt<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="prompt" id="idm46586656915472"/>,<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="shell" data-secondary="prompt" id="idm46586656914400"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="$ (dollar sign)" data-secondary="shell prompt" id="idm46586656854128"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dollar sign ($)" data-secondary="shell prompt" id="idm46586656853072"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="command" data-secondary="running" data-see="running commands" id="idm46586656872896"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="running commands" data-secondary="shell prompt" id="idm46586656870864"/>
which waits for you to run any command you may know:<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm46586656866000-marker" href="preface01.xhtml#idm46586656866000">1</a></sup></p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">$</pre>

<p>It’s challenging because everything beyond the prompt is your
responsibility. There are no friendly icons, buttons, or menus to
guide you. Instead, every command you type is a creative act. This is
true for basic commands, like listing your files:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">$ <strong>ls</strong></pre>

<p>and more elaborate commands like this one:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="paste command" data-secondary="examples" id="idm46586651253872"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sed command" data-secondary="examples" id="idm46586651252656"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="process substitution" data-secondary="examples" id="idm46586656912928"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="pipes" data-secondary="piping commands to bash" data-tertiary="examples" id="idm46586656911776"/></p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ <strong>paste &lt;(echo {1..10}.jpg | sed 's/ /\n/g') \
        &lt;(echo {0..9}.jpg | sed 's/ /\n/g') \
  | sed 's/^/mv /' \
  | bash</strong></pre>

<p>If you’re staring at the preceding command and thinking, “What the
heck is <em>that</em>?” or “I would never need such a complex command,” then
this book is for you.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm46586656684352-marker" href="preface01.xhtml#idm46586656684352">2</a></sup></p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What You’ll Learn"><div class="sect1" id="idm46586656682352">
<h1>What You’ll Learn</h1>

<p>This book will make you faster and more effective at three essential
skills:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Choosing or constructing commands to solve a business problem at hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running those commands efficiently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigating the Linux filesystem with ease</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>By the end, you’ll understand what happens behind the scenes when you
run a command, so you can better predict the results (and not develop
superstitions). You’ll see a dozen different methods for launching
commands and learn when to use each one for best advantage. You’ll
also learn practical tips and tricks to make you more productive, such
as:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Building complex commands out of simpler ones, step-by-step, to
solve real-world problems, such as managing passwords or generating
ten thousand test files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saving time by organizing your home directory intelligently so you
don’t have to hunt for files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transforming text files and querying them like databases to achieve
business goals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Controlling point-and-click features of Linux from the command line,
such as copying and pasting with the clipboard, and retrieving and
processing web data, without lifting your hands from the keyboard</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of all, you’ll learn general best practices so no matter which
commands you run, you can become more successful in everyday Linux use
and more competitive on the job market. This is the book I wish I had
when I learned Linux.</p>

<h1>What This Book Is Not</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="efficient, definition of" id="idm46586655918048"/>
This book won’t optimize your Linux computer to make it run more
efficiently.  It makes <em>you</em> more efficient at interacting with Linux.</p>

<p>This book is also not a comprehensive reference for the command line—there are hundreds of commands and features that I don’t
mention. This book is about expertise. It teaches a carefully selected
set of command-line knowledge in a practical order to build your
skills. For a reference-style guide, try my previous book, <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/46N1v"><em>Linux
Pocket Guide</em></a> (O’Reilly).</p>

<h1>Audience and Prerequisites</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="prerequisites for this book" id="idm46586655913456"/>
This book assumes you have Linux experience; <em>it’s not an
introduction</em>. It’s for users who want to improve their
command-line skills, such as students, system administrators, software
developers, site reliability engineers, test engineers, and general
Linux enthusiasts. Advanced Linux users may find some useful material
as well, especially if they learned to run commands by trial and error
and want to strengthen their conceptual understanding.</p>

<p>To benefit most from this book, you should already be comfortable with
the following topics (if you’re not, see <a data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#appendix_linux">Appendix A</a> for a quick
refresher):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating and editing text files with a text editor such as <code>vim</code>
(<code>vi</code>), <code>emacs</code>, <code>nano</code>, or <code>pico</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic file-handling commands such as <code>cp</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cp command" id="idm46586653226208"/> (copy), <code>mv</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="mv command" id="idm46586653225200"/> (move or rename),
<code>rm</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="rm command" id="idm46586653224080"/> (remove or delete), and <code>chmod</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="chmod command" id="idm46586653222992"/> (change file permissions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic file-viewing commands such as <code>cat</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cat command" id="idm46586653221168"/> (view an entire file)
and <code>less</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="less command" id="idm46586656680752"/> (view one page at a time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic directory commands such as <code>cd</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cd command" id="idm46586656678576"/> (change directory), <code>ls</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ls command" id="idm46586656677456"/> (list files
in a directory), <code>mkdir</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="mkdir command" id="idm46586656676320"/> (create directory), <code>rmdir</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="rmdir command" id="idm46586656675200"/> (remove directory),
and <code>pwd</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="pwd command" id="idm46586656674064"/> (display your current directory name)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basics of shell scripts<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="shell" data-secondary="scripts" data-tertiary="basics" id="idm46586656112464"/>: storing Linux commands in a file,
making the file executable (with <code>chmod 755</code> or <code>chmod +x</code>), and running
the file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viewing Linux’s built-in documentation, known as manpages<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="manpages" id="idm46586656109280"/>, with the
<code>man</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="man command" id="idm46586656108080"/> command (example: <code>man cat</code> displays documentation on the <code>cat</code>
command)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming the superuser with the <code>sudo</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sudo command" id="idm46586656104960"/> command for full access to
your Linux system (example: <code>sudo nano /etc/hosts</code> edits the system file
<em>/etc/hosts</em>,<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="/etc/hosts file" id="idm46586651265488"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="/etc/hosts file" data-primary-sortas="etc hosts" id="idm46586651264752"/> which is protected from
ordinary users)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If you also know common command-line features such as pattern matching
for filenames (with the <code>*</code> and <code>?</code> symbols), input/output redirection
(<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>), and pipes (<code>|</code>), you are off to a good start.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Your Shell"><div class="sect1" id="idm46586651260784">
<h1>Your Shell</h1>

<p>I assume your Linux shell is <code>bash</code>,<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="bash" data-secondary="default shell" data-tertiary="this book" id="idm46586651258368"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="shell" data-secondary="bash" data-see="bash" id="idm46586651257088"/>  which is the default shell for
most Linux distributions. Whenever I write “the shell,” I mean
<code>bash</code>. Most of the ideas I present apply to other shells too, such as
<code>zsh</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="zsh shell" id="idm46586653218112"/> or <code>dash</code><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dash shell" id="idm46586653216992"/>; see <a data-type="xref" href="app02.xhtml#appendix_shells">Appendix B</a> to help translate this book’s
examples for other shells. Much of the material will work unchanged on
the Apple Mac Terminal<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mac Terminal, shells" id="idm46586653215328"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="terminal program" data-secondary="Mac Terminal" id="idm46586653214656"/> as well, which runs <code>zsh</code> by default but can
also run <code>bash</code>.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm46586653212752-marker" href="preface01.xhtml#idm46586653212752">3</a></sup></p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>This book was a joy to write. Thanks to the amazing folks at O’Reilly,
especially editors Virginia Wilson and John Devins, production editors
Caitlin Ghegan and Gregory Hyman, content manager Kristen Brown, copyeditor
Kim Wimpsett, index editor Sue Klefstad, and the ever-helpful tools team. I’m also very
grateful to the book’s technical reviewers, Paul Bayer, John Bonesio,
Dan Ritter, and Carla Schroder, for many insightful comments and
criticisms. Thanks also to the Boston Linux Users Group for title
suggestions. Special thanks to Maggie Johnson at Google for her kind
permission to write the book.</p>

<p>I’d like to offer my deepest thanks to Chip Andrews, Matthew Diaz, and
Robert Strandh, who were fellow students at The Johns Hopkins
University 35 years ago. They noticed my new and growing interest in
Unix and, to my utter surprise, recommended that the Computer Science
Department hire me as their next system administrator. Their small act
of faith changed the trajectory of my life. (Robert also gets credit
for the tip on touch-typing in <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#ch_history">Chapter 3</a>.) Thanks also to the
creators and maintainers of Linux, GNU Emacs, Git, AsciiDoc, and many
other open source 
<span class="keep-together">tools—without</span> these smart and generous people, my
career would have been very different indeed.</p>

<p>As always, thank you to my wonderful family, Lisa and Sophia, for
their love and patience.</p>
