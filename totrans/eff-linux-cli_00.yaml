- en: If you’re like most Linux users, you learned your early command-line skills
    on the job, or by reading an intro book, or by installing Linux at home and just
    trying things out. I’ve written this book to help you take the next step—to build
    intermediate to advanced skills at the Linux command line. It’s filled with techniques
    and concepts that I hope will transform how you interact with Linux and boost
    your productivity. Think of it as a second book on Linux use that takes you beyond
    the basics.

    It’s simple because you’re presented with nothing but a prompt, which waits for
    you to run any command you may know:^([1](preface01.xhtml#idm46586656866000))

    editors Virginia Wilson and John Devins, production editors Caitlin Ghegan and
    Gregory Hyman, content manager Kristen Brown, copyeditor Kim Wimpsett, index editor
    Sue Klefstad, and the ever-helpful tools team. I’m also very grateful to the book’s
    technical reviewers, Paul Bayer, John Bonesio, Dan Ritter, and Carla Schroder,
    for many insightful comments and criticisms. Thanks also to the Boston Linux Users
    Group for title suggestions. Special thanks to Maggie Johnson at Google for her
    kind permission to write the book.

    Strandh, who were fellow students at The Johns Hopkins University 35 years ago.
    They noticed my new and growing interest in Unix and, to my utter surprise, recommended
    that the Computer Science Department hire me as their next system administrator.
    Their small act of faith changed the trajectory of my life. (Robert also gets
    credit for the tip on touch-typing in [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch_history).) Thanks
    also to the creators and maintainers of Linux, GNU Emacs, Git, AsciiDoc, and many
    other open source tools—without these smart and generous people, my career would
    have been very different indeed.
