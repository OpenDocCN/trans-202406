- en: Portability is sometimes a concern when building cloud native applications.
    The application might have a requirement to be deployed across multiple cloud
    providers or even on-premises. These requirements are generally driven by stakeholders,
    whether they are customers using the application or the business building the
    application. It might be the case that the application is deployed by the customer,
    either on their own hardware or in their own account on the cloud provider of
    their choice. Regardless of the reasons, the requirement for portability should
    be treated like any other architecturally significant requirement. It should be
    driven by the business with careful consideration to the costs and trade-offs.
