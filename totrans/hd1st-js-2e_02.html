<p><strong>You already know about variables, types, expressions... we could go on.</strong> The point is, you already know a few things about JavaScript. In fact, you know enough to write some <strong>real code</strong>. Some code that does something interesting, some code that someone would want to use. What you’re lacking is the <strong>real experience</strong> of writing code, and we’re going to remedy that right here and now. How? By jumping in head first and coding up a casual game, all written in JavaScript. Our goal is ambitious but we’re going to take it one step at a time. Come on, let’s get this started, and if you want to launch the next startup, we won’t stand in your way; the code is yours.</p>
<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Let’s build a Battleship game"><div class="sect1" id="letapostrophes_build_a_battleship_game">
<h1>Let’s build a Battleship game</h1>
<p>It’s you against the browser: the browser hides ships and your job is to seek them out and destroy them. Of course, unlike the real Battleship game, in this one you don’t place any ships of your own. Instead, your job is to sink the computer’s ships in the fewest number of guesses.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Sink the browser’s ships in the fewest number of guesses. You’re given a rating, based on how well you perform.</p>
<p><strong>Setup</strong>: When the game program is launched, the computer places ships on a virtual grid. When that’s done, the game asks for your first guess.</p>
<p><strong>How you play:</strong> The browser will prompt you to enter a guess and you’ll type in a grid location. In response to your guess, you’ll see a result of “Hit”, “Miss”, or “You sank my battleship!” When you sink all the ships, the game ends by displaying your rating.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="... a simplified Battleship"><div class="sect2" id="hellip_a_simplified_battleship">
<h2>... a simplified Battleship</h2>
<p>For our first attempt we’re going to start simpler than the full-blown 7x7 graphical version with three ships. Instead we’re going to start with a nice 1-D grid with seven locations and one ship to find. It will be crude, but our focus is on designing the basic code for the game, not the look and feel (at least for now).</p>
<p>Don’t worry; by starting with a simplified version of the game, you get a big head start on building the full game later. This also gives us a nice chunk to bite off for your first real JavaScript program (not counting the Serious Business Application from <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#a_quick_dip_into_javascript_getting_your">Chapter 1</a>, of course). So, we’ll build the simple version of the game in this chapter, and get to the deluxe version later in the book after you’ve learned a bit more about JavaScript.</p>

<p>We know we’ll need variables, and some numbers and strings, and if statements, and conditional tests, and loops... but where and how many? And how do we put it all together? To answer these questions, we need more information about what the game should do.</p>
<p>First, we need to figure out the general flow of the game. Here’s the basic idea:</p>

<p>We have a pretty good idea about how this game is going to work from the high-level design and professional looking flowchart, but let’s nail down just a few more of the details before we begin writing the code.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Representing the ships"><div class="sect2" id="representing_the_ships">
<h2>Representing the ships</h2>
<p>For one thing, we can start by figuring out how to represent a ship in our grid. Keep in mind that the virtual grid is... well, <em>virtual</em>. In other words, it doesn’t exist anywhere in the program. As long as both the game and the user know that the battleship is hidden in three consecutive cells out of a possible seven (starting at zero), the row itself doesn’t have to be represented in code. You might be tempted to build something that holds all seven locations and then to try to place the ship in those locations. But, we don’t need to. We just need to know the cells where the ship is located, say, at cells 1, 2 and 3.</p>

<h2>Getting user input</h2>
<p>What about getting user input? We can do that with the <code>prompt</code> function. Whenever we need to get a new location from the user, we’ll use <code>prompt</code> to display a message and get the input, which is just a number between 0 and 6, from the user.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Displaying the results"><div class="sect2" id="displaying_the_results">
<h2>Displaying the results</h2>
<p>What about output? For now, we’ll continue to use <code>alert</code> to show the output of the game. It’s a bit clunky, but it’ll work. (For the real game, later in the book, we’ll be updating the web page instead, but we’ve got a way to go before we get there.)</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Working through the Pseudocode"><div class="sect1" id="working_through_the_pseudocode">
<h1>Working through the Pseudocode</h1>
<p>We need an approach to planning and writing our code. We’re going to start by writing <em>pseudocode.</em> Pseudocode is halfway between real JavaScript code and a plain English description of the program, and as you’ll see, it will help us think through how the program is going to work without fully having to develop the <em>real code</em>.</p>
<p>In this pseudocode for Simple Battleship, we’ve included a section that describes the variables we’ll need, and a section describing the logic of the program. The variables will tell us what we need to keep track of in our code, and the logic describes what the code has to faithfully implement to create the game.</p>

<strong>location2 = 4;</strong>
<strong>location3 = 5;</strong></pre>
<p>Use the following sequence as your test user input:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>1, 4, 2, 3, 5</strong></pre>
<p>Now, using the pseudocode on the previous page, walk through each step of code and see how this works given the user input. Put your notes below. We’ve begun the exercise for you below. If this is your first time walking through pseudocode, take your time and see how it all works.</p>

<h1>Writing the Simple Battleship code</h1>

<h1>Now let’s write the game logic</h1>
<p>We’ve got the variables out of the way, so let’s dig into the actual pseudocode that implements the game. We’ll break this into a few pieces. The first thing you’re going to want to do is implement the loop: it needs to keep looping while the ship isn’t sunk. From there we’ll take care of getting the guess from the user and validating it—you know, making sure it really is a number between 0 and 6— and then we’ll write the logic to check for a hit on a ship and to see if the ship is sunk. Last, we’ll create a little report for the user with the number of guesses it took to sink the ship.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="How prompt works"><div class="sect1" id="how_prompt_works">
<h1>How prompt works</h1>
<p>The browser provides a built-in function you can use to get input from the user, named <code>prompt</code>. The <code>prompt</code> function is a lot like the <code>alert</code> function you’ve already used—<code>prompt</code> causes a dialog to be displayed with a string that you provide, just like <code>alert</code>—but it also provides the user with a place to type a response. That response, in the form of a string, is then returned as a result of calling the function. Now, if the user cancels the dialog or doesn’t enter anything, then <code>null</code> is returned instead.</p>

<p><strong>You might be tempted to try this code now...</strong></p>
<p>...but don’t. If you do, your browser will start an <em>infinite loop</em> of asking you for a guess, and then asking you for a guess, and so on, without any means of stopping the loop (other than using your operating system to force the browser process to stop).</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Checking the user’s guess"><div class="sect1" id="checking_the_userapostrophes_guess">
<h1>Checking the user’s guess</h1>
<p>If you look at the pseudocode, to check the user’s guess we need to first make sure the user has entered a valid input. If so, then we also check to see if the guess was a hit or miss. We’ll also want to make sure we appropriately update the <code>guesses</code> and <code>hits</code> variables. Let’s get started by checking the validity of the user’s input, and if the input is valid, we’ll increment the <code>guesses</code> variable. After that we’ll write the code to see if the user has a hit or miss.</p>

<h1>there are no Dumb Questions</h1>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> I noticed there is a cancel button on the prompt dialog box. What gets returned from the prompt function if the user hits cancel?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> If you click cancel in the prompt dialog box then prompt returns the value null rather than a string. Remember that null means “no value”, which is appropriate in this case because you’ve cancelled without entering a value. We can use the fact that the value returned from prompt is null to check to see if the user clicked cancel, and if they did, then we could, say, end the game. We’re not doing that in our code, but keep this idea in the back of your mind as we might use it later in the book.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> You said that prompt always returns a string. So how can we compare a string value, like “0” or “6”, to numbers, like 0 and 6?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> In this situation, JavaScript tries to convert the string in guess to a number in order to do the comparisons, guess &lt; 0 and guess &gt; 6. As long as you enter only a number, like 4, JavaScript knows how to convert the string “4” to the number 4 when it needs to. We’ll come back to the topic of type conversion in more detail later.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> What happens if the user enters something that isn’t a number into the prompt? Like “six” or “quit”?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> In that case, JavaScript won’t be able to convert the string to a number for the comparison. So, you’d be comparing “six” to 6 or “quit” to 6, and that kind of comparison will return false, which will lead to a MISS. In a more robust version of battleship, we’ll check the user input more carefully and make sure they’ve entered a number first.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> With the OR operator, is it true if only one or the other is true, or can both be true?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Yes, both can be true. The result of the OR operator (||) is true if either of the tests is true, or if both are true. If both are false, then the result is false.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> Is there an AND operator?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Yes! The AND operator (&amp;&amp;) works similarly to OR, except that the result of AND is true only if both tests are true.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> What’s an infinite loop?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Great question. An infinite loop is one of the many problems that plague programmers. Remember that a loop requires a conditional test, and the loop will continue as long as that conditional test is true. If your code never does anything to change things so that the conditional test is false at some point, the loop will continue forever. And ever. Until you kill your browser or reboot.</p>

<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="two_minute_guide_to_boolean_operators">
<h1>Two-minute Guide to Boolean Operators</h1>
<p>A boolean operator is used in a boolean expression, which results in a true or false value. There are two kinds of boolean operators: comparison operators and logical operators.</p>
<p><strong>Comparison Operators</strong></p>
<p>Comparison operators compare two values. Here are some common comparison operators:</p>
<table class="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>&lt;</strong></code></td>
<td>means “less than”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>&gt;</strong></code></td>
<td>means “greater than”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>==</strong></code></td>
<td>means “equal to”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>===</strong></code></td>
<td>means “exactly equal to” (we’ll come back to this one later)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>&lt;=</strong></code></td>
<td>means “less than or equal to”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>&gt;=</strong></code></td>
<td>means “greater than or equal to”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>!=</strong></code></td>
<td>means “not equal to”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Logical Operators</strong></p>
<p>Logical operators combine two boolean expressions to create one boolean result (true or false). Here are two logical operators:</p>
<table class="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>||</strong></code></td>
<td>means OR. Results in true if <em>either</em> of the two expressions is true.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>&amp;&amp;</strong></code></td>
<td>means AND. Results in true if <em>both</em> of the two expressions are true.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Another logical operator is NOT, which acts on one boolean expression (rather than two):</p>
<table class="border">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code><strong>!</strong></code></td>
<td>means NOT. Results in true if the expression evaluates to false.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>We’re almost there; we’ve almost got this game logic nailed down. Looking at the pseudocode again, what we need to do now is test to see if we have three hits. If we do, then we’ve sunk a battleship. And, if we’ve sunk a battleship then we need to set <code>isSunk</code> to true and also tell the user they’ve destroyed a ship. Let’s sketch out the code again before adding it in:</p>

<h1>Provide some post-game analysis</h1>
<p>After <code>isSunk</code> is set to true, the while loop is going to stop looping. That’s right, this program we’ve come to know so well is going to stop executing the body of the while loop, and before you know it the game’s going to be over. But, we still owe the user some stats on how they did. Here’s some code that does that:</p>

<p>QA, or quality assurance, is the process of testing software to find defects. So we’re going to do a little QA on this code.

<p><strong>Boolean operators allow you to write more complex statements of logic.</strong></p>
<p>You’ve seen enough conditionals to know how to test, say, if the temperature is greater than 32 degrees. Or, that a variable that represents whether an item is inStock is true. But sometimes we need to test more. Sometimes we need to know not only if a value is greater than 32, but also if it’s less than 100. Or, if an item is inStock, and also onSale. Or that an item is on sale only on Tuesdays when the user is a VIP member. So, you see, these conditionals can get complex.</p>
<p>Let’s step through a few to get a better idea of how they work.</p>
<p>Say we need to test that an item is inStock AND onSale. We could do that like this:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/2-f0020-02.png" alt="Image" width="608" height="255"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>We can simplify this code by combining these two conditionals together. Unlike in Simple Battleship, where we tested if guess &lt; 0 OR guess &gt; 6, here we want to know if inStock is true AND onSale is true. Let’s see how to do that...</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/2-f0021-01.png" alt="Image" width="792" height="200"/>

</div></figure>
<p>We don’t have to stop there; we can use multiple boolean operators to combine conditionals in a variety of ways:</p>

<p>We don’t know how to bring this up, but you’ve been a little verbose in specifying your conditionals. What do we mean? Take this condition for instance:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/2-f0023-02.png" alt="Image" width="435" height="238"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>As it turns out, that’s a bit of overkill. The whole point of a conditional is that it evaluates to either true or false, but our boolean variable <code>inStock</code> already <em>is</em> one of those values. So, we don’t need to compare the variable to anything; it can just stand on its own. That is, we can just write this instead:</p>

<h1>Finishing the Simple Battleship game</h1>
<p>Yes, we still have one little matter to take care of because right now you’ve hard coded the location of the ship—no matter how many times you play the game, the ship is always at locations 3, 4 and 5. That actually works out well for testing, but we really need to randomly place the ship to make it a little more interesting to the user.</p>
<p>Let’s step back and think about the right way to place a ship on the 1-D grid of seven cells. We need a starting location that allows us to place three consecutive positions on the grid. That means we need a starting location from zero to four.</p>

<p>Okay, but how do we generate a random number? That’s where we turn to JavaScript and its built-in functions. More specifically, JavaScript comes with a bunch of built-in math-related functions, including a couple that can be used to generate random numbers. Now we’re going to get deeper into built-in functions, and functions in general, a little later in the book. For now, we’re just going to make use of these functions to get our job done.</p>

<h1>The recipe for generating a random number</h1>
<p>We’re going to start with the <code>Math.random</code> function. By calling this function we’ll get back a random decimal number:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="assets/2-f0025-01.png" alt="Image" width="622" height="318"/>
<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>What we need is an integer between 0 and 4—that is, 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4—not a decimal number, like 0.34. To start, we could multiply the number returned by <code>Math.random</code> by 5 to get a little closer; here’s what we mean...</p>

<h6></h6>
</div></figure>
<p>That’s closer! Now all we need to do is clip off the end of the number to give us an integer number. To do that we can use another built-in Math function, Math.floor:</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> If we’re trying to generate a number between 0 and 4, why does the code have a 5 in it, as in</strong></p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>Math.floor(Math.random() * 5)?</strong></pre>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> Good question. First, Math.random generates a number between 0 and 1, but not including 1. The maximum number you can get from Math.random is 0.999.... When you multiply that number by 5, the highest number you’ll get is 4.999... Math.floor always rounds a number down, so 1.2 becomes 1, but so does 1.9999. If we generate a number from 0 to 4.999... then everything will be rounded down to 0 to 4. This is not the only way to do it, and in other languages it’s often done differently, but this is how you’ll see it done in most JavaScript code.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> So if I wanted a random number between 0 and 100 (including 100), I’d write</strong></p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>Math.floor(Math.random() * 101)?</strong></pre>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> That’s right! Multiplying by 101, and using Math.floor to round down, ensures that your result will be at most 100.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> What are the parentheses for in Math.random()?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> We use parentheses whenever we “call” a function. Sometimes we need to hand a value to a function, like we do when we use alert to display a message, and sometimes we don’t, like when we use Math.random. But whenever you’re calling a function (whether it’s built-in or not), you’ll need to use parentheses. Don’t worry about this right now; we’ll get into all these details in the next chapter.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">Q:</span> I can’t get my battleship game to work. I’m not seeing anything in my web page except the “Play battleship” heading. How can I figure out what I did wrong?</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#412985">A:</span></strong> This is where using the console can come in handy. If you’ve made an error like forgetting a quote on a string, then JavaScript will typically complain about the syntax of your program not being right, and may even show you the line number where your error is. Sometimes errors are more subtle, however. For instance, if you mistakenly write isSunk = false instead of isSunk == false, you won’t see a JavaScript error, but your code won’t behave as you expect it to. For this kind of error, try using console.log to display the values of your variables at various points in your code to see if you can track down the error.</p>

<h1>Congrats on your first true JavaScript program, and a short word about reusing code</h1>
<p>You’ve probably noticed that we made use of a few <em>built-in functions</em> like <code>alert</code>, <code>prompt</code>, <code>console.log</code> and <code>Math.random</code>. With very little effort, these functions have given you the ability to pop up dialog boxes, log output to the console and generate random numbers, almost like magic. But, these built-in functions are just packaged up code that’s already been written for you, and as you can see their power is that you can use and reuse them just by making a call to them when you need them.</p>
<p>Now there’s a lot to learn about functions, how to call them, what kinds of values you can pass them, and so on, and we’re going to start getting into all that in the next chapter where you learn to create your own functions.</p>
<p>But before you get there you’ve got the bullet points to review, a crossword puzzle to complete... oh, and a good night’s sleep to let everything sink in.</p>

<li><p>Before you begin writing a program, it’s a good idea to sketch out what your program needs to do with pseudocode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> is an approximation of what your real code should do.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two kinds of boolean operators: comparison operators and logical operators. When used in an expression, boolean operators result in a true or false value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comparison</strong> operators compare two values and result in true or false. For example, we can use the boolean comparison operator &lt; (“less than”) like this: 3 &lt; 6. This expression results in true.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Logical</strong> operators combine two boolean values. For example true || false results in true; true &amp;&amp; false results in false.</p></li>
<li><p>You can generate a random number between 0 and 1 (including 0, but not including 1) using the <strong>Math.random</strong> function.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Math.floor</strong> function rounds down a decimal number to the nearest integer.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you use Math with an uppercase M, and not m, when using Math.random and Math.floor.</p></li>
<li><p>The JavaScript function <strong>prompt</strong> shows a dialog with message and a space for the user to enter a value.</p></li>
