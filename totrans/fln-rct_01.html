<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  This book is not for people who want to learn how to use React. If you’re&#13;
  unfamiliar with React and looking for a tutorial, a great place to start is&#13;
  the React documentation over at <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://react.dev/"><em>react.dev</em></a>. Instead, this book is for the&#13;
  curious: people who aren’t as interested in how to use React, but who are&#13;
  more interested in <em>how React works</em>.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  In our time together, we will go on a journey through a number of React&#13;
  concepts and understand their underlying mechanism, exploring how it all fits&#13;
  together to enable us to create applications using React more effectively. In&#13;
  our pursuit of understanding the underlying mechanism, we will develop the&#13;
  mental models necessary to reason about React and its ecosystem with a high&#13;
  degree of fidelity.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  This book assumes we have a satisfactory understanding of this statement:&#13;
  browsers render web pages. Web pages are HTML documents that are styled by CSS&#13;
  and made interactive with JavaScript. It also assumes we’re somewhat&#13;
  familiar with how to use React, and that we’ve built a React app or two in our&#13;
  time. Ideally, some of our React apps are in production.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  We’ll start with an introduction to React and recap its history, casting&#13;
  our minds back to 2013 when it was first released as open source software. From there, we’ll&#13;
  explore the core concepts of React, including the component model, the virtual&#13;
  DOM, and reconciliation. We’ll dive into the compiler theory of how JSX works, talk about fibers, and understand its concurrent programming model in depth. This way we’ll glean powerful takeaways that will help us more fluently memoize what ought to be memoized and defer rendering work that ought to be deferred through powerful primitives like <code>React.memo</code> and&#13;
  <code>useTransition</code>.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  In the second half of this book, we’ll explore React frameworks: what problems they&#13;
  solve, and the mechanisms by which they solve them. We’ll do so by writing&#13;
  our own framework that solves three salient problems across nearly all web&#13;
  applications: server rendering, routing, and data fetching.&#13;
</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>&#13;
  Once we solve these problems for ourselves, understanding how frameworks solve&#13;
  them becomes far more approachable. We’ll also dive deep into React Server&#13;
  Components (RSCs) and server actions, understanding the role of&#13;
  next-generation tooling, like bundlers and isomorphic routers.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  Finally, we’ll zoom out from React and look at alternatives like Vue,&#13;
  Solid, Angular, Qwik, and more. We’ll explore signals and fine-grained&#13;
  reactivity in contrast to React’s coarser reactivity model. We’ll also&#13;
  explore React’s response to signals: the Forget toolchain and how it&#13;
  stacks up when compared to signals.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  There’s so much to get into, so let’s not waste any more time.&#13;
  Let’s get started!&#13;

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>
PROD: Please reach out to author to find out if they will be uploading code examples to oreilly.com or their own site (e.g., GitHub). If there is no code download, delete this whole section. If there is, when you email digidist with the link, let them know what you filled in for title_title (should be as close to book title as possible, i.e., learning_python_2e). This info will determine where digidist loads the files.

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  This book is the first book that I’ve ever written, and I am beyond&#13;
  thankful that I did not do it alone. What you’re about to read is the&#13;
  combined effort of a number of brilliant people who have worked in concert to&#13;
  make this possible. On this page, we acknowledge these people for their&#13;
  contributions to this body of text.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  Please do not skip this, because these people deserve your attention and your&#13;
  gratitude. Let’s start off with the people who have helped me directly with this&#13;
  book:&#13;
</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
  <li>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      Number one is always my wife, Lea. I’ve spent a lot of&#13;
      time writing this book, often at the cost of together time and family&#13;
      time. Because of my joy in the subject matter and my desire to share it&#13;
      with all of you, working on this book has slightly eaten into vacation time&#13;
      and other opportunities to spend time with my wife. She has been nothing&#13;
      but supportive and encouraging, and I am so thankful for her.&#13;
    </p>&#13;
  </li>&#13;
  <li>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      Shira Evans, my development editor on this book. Shira&#13;
      from O’Reilly has been a joy to work with and has been nothing short&#13;
      of supportive, encouraging, and understanding, even when we were faced&#13;
      with a number of delays since new things kept coming up with React, like&#13;
      Forget and server actions. Shira patiently saw us through all of it, and I&#13;
      am so thankful for her.&#13;
    </p>&#13;
  </li>&#13;
  <li>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      My dear friend and brother Kent C. Dodds (<em>@kentcdodds</em>)&#13;
      for his continued mentorship outside the capacities of this book, and for&#13;
      his foreword in this book. Kent has been a dear friend and mentor for&#13;
      years, and I am so thankful for his continued support and encouragement.&#13;
    </p>&#13;
  </li>&#13;
  <li>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      The reviewers. This book would not be possible without the incredible care&#13;
      and attention to detail by the reviewers who partnered with me on this&#13;
      book:&#13;

    <ul>&#13;
      <li>Adam Rackis (<em>@adamrackis</em>)</li>&#13;

      <li>Fabien Bernard (<em>@fabien0102</em>)</li>&#13;
      <li>Kent C. Dodds (<em>@kentcdodds</em>)</li>&#13;
      <li>Mark Erikson (<em>@acemarke</em>)</li>&#13;
      <li>Lenz Weber-Tronic (<em>@phry</em>)</li>&#13;
      <li>Rick Hanlon II (<em>@rickhanlonii</em>)</li>&#13;
      <li>Sergeii Kirianov (<em>@SergiiKirianov</em>)</li>&#13;
      <li>Matheus Albuquerque (<em>@ythecombinator</em>)</li>&#13;
    </ul>&#13;
  </li>&#13;
  <li>&#13;
    <p>&#13;
      The React team at Meta for their continued work on React, continuing to&#13;
      push the boundaries of what’s possible with React and making it a joy&#13;
      to use through their brilliance, ingenuity, and engineering acumen. In&#13;
      particular, Dan Abramov (<em>@dan_abramov</em>), who took the time to explain the&#13;
      role of the bundler in the React Server Components architecture, as well&#13;
      as for contributing a significant portion of  <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#ch09">Chapter 9</a> on React Server Components.&#13;
    </p>&#13;
  </li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  Finally, I’d like to thank you, the reader, for your interest in this&#13;
  book. I hope you find it as rewarding to read as I have found it to write.&#13;
