- en: When Craig, Joe, and I started Kubernetes nearly eight years ago, I think we
    all recognized its power to transform the way the world developed and delivered
    software. I don’t think we knew, or even hoped to believe, how quickly this transformation
    would come. Kubernetes is now the foundation for the development of portable,
    reliable systems spanning the major public clouds, private clouds, and bare-metal
    environments. However, even as Kubernetes has become ubiquitous to the point where
    you can spin up a cluster in the cloud in less than five minutes, it is still
    far less obvious to determine where to go once you have created that cluster.
    It is fantastic that we have seen such significant strides forward in the operationalization
    of Kubernetes itself, but it is only a part of the solution. It is the foundation
    on which applications will be built, and it provides a large library of APIs and
    tools for building these applications, but it does little to provide the application
    architect or developer with any hints or guidance for how these various pieces
    can be combined into a complete, reliable system that satisfies their business
    needs and goals.

  zh: 当Craig、Joe和我近八年前启动Kubernetes时，我认为我们都意识到它改变了全球软件开发和交付方式的潜力。我不认为我们知道，甚至希望相信，这种转变会来得如此迅速。Kubernetes现在是开发跨主要公共云、私有云和裸机环境中便携可靠系统的基础。然而，即使Kubernetes已经变得无处不在，以至于您可以在云中不到五分钟内启动一个集群，确定创建了该集群后该何去何从仍然不那么明显。我们看到Kubernetes的运营化取得了如此重大的进展是非常棒的，但这只是解决方案的一部分。它是构建应用程序的基础，并提供了大量的API和工具库来构建这些应用程序，但它对于应用架构师或开发人员如何将这些不同的组件结合成满足其业务需求和目标的完整可靠系统提供的提示或指导甚少。
- en: Although the necessary perspective and experience for what to do with your Kubernetes
    cluster can be achieved through past experience with similar systems, or via trial
    and error, this is expensive both in terms of time and the quality of systems
    delivered to our end users. When you are starting to deliver mission-critical
    services on top of a system like Kubernetes, learning your way via trial and error
    simply takes too much time and results in very real problems of downtime and disruption.

  zh: 尽管通过类似系统的过去经验或试错可以获得对如何处理您的Kubernetes集群的必要视角和经验，但无论是时间成本还是交付给最终用户的系统质量，这都是昂贵的。当您开始在类似Kubernetes这样的系统之上交付关键任务服务时，通过试错学习的方式简直是太费时间，并且会导致实际的停机和中断问题。
- en: This then is why Bilgin and Roland’s book is so valuable. *Kubernetes Patterns*
    enables you to learn from the previous experience that we have encoded into the
    APIs and tools that make up Kubernetes. Kubernetes is the by-product of the community’s
    experience building and delivering many different, reliable distributed systems
    in a variety of different environments. Each object and capability added to Kubernetes
    represents a foundational tool that has been designed and purpose-built to solve
    a specific need for the software designer. This book explains how the concepts
    in Kubernetes solve real-world problems and how to adapt and use these concepts
    to build the system that you are working on today.

  zh: 这就是为什么Bilgin和Roland的书如此宝贵。*Kubernetes模式*使您能够从我们编码到Kubernetes API和工具中的先前经验中学习。Kubernetes是社区在各种不同环境中构建和交付许多不同可靠分布式系统经验的副产品。Kubernetes中添加的每个对象和功能代表了为软件设计师解决特定需求而设计和定制的基础工具。本书解释了Kubernetes中的概念如何解决现实世界的问题，以及如何调整和使用这些概念来构建您今天正在开发的系统。
- en: In developing Kubernetes, we always said that our North Star was making the
    development of distributed systems a CS 101 exercise. If we have managed to achieve
    that goal successfully, it is books like this one that are the textbooks for such
    a class. Bilgin and Roland have captured the essential tools of the Kubernetes
    developer and distilled them into segments that are easy to approach and consume.
    As you finish this book, you will become aware not just of the components available
    to you in Kubernetes but also the “why” and “how” of building systems with those
    components.

  zh: 在开发Kubernetes时，我们始终说我们的北极星是将分布式系统开发变成CS 101课程。如果我们成功实现了这一目标，像这样的书籍就是这类课程的教科书。Bilgin和Roland捕捉了Kubernetes开发人员的基本工具，并将它们分解成易于理解和消化的部分。当您完成本书时，您将意识到不仅可以在Kubernetes中使用哪些组件，还可以了解使用这些组件构建系统的“为什么”和“如何”。
