<h1><span class="label">Chapter 1. </span>Getting Started with Linux</h1>
<p>Linux system administration means different things to different people. Administration, for this book, means the daily actions that a Linux system administrator (sysadmin) must take to manage and support users, maintain system health, implement best practices for security, install software, and perform housekeeping tasks. This chapter covers Linux installation, initial setup, and system exploration using simple shell commands.</p>
<p>You’ll spend a significant portion of your time at the command line, also known as the command-line interface (CLI). Linux system administrators rarely install or use GUIs on their supported server systems. This chapter introduces you to the CLI and some simple commands to navigate the filesystem, locate important files, and familiarize yourself with the Linux CLI.</p>

<h1>Installing Linux</h1>
<p>One of the first things every Linux system administrator learns is how to install Linux.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="installation" data-secondary="installing Linux" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_instl"/> There’s no single <em>correct</em> way to install Linux, but a few guidelines and suggestions will make your life easier as your users’ needs change.</p>
<p>While this section won’t go into detailed step-by-step instructions on installing Linux, the basic steps are outlined here. For most junior-level sysadmins, system installation generally occurs via automated means such as Kickstart or another enterprise-level delivery system.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Preparing Your System for Linux" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="preparing_your_system_for_linux">
<h2>Preparing Your System for Linux</h2>
<p>If this is your first time installing Linux, I suggest that you install it into a virtual machine (VM). <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="installation" data-secondary="installing Linux" data-tertiary="preparing your system for Linux" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875852624"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="virtual machines (VMs)" data-secondary="installing Linux in" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875776160"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="VMs" data-see="virtual machines" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875851728"/>That way, you don’t have to dedicate an entire piece of hardware to a learning system and you won’t potentially render your system inoperable by attempting to install Linux in parallel to your current system, creating a multiboot computer. (Setting up multibooting is a more advanced concept and is beyond the scope of this book.)</p>
<p>If you don’t already have it installed, a good place to start with virtualization is to download and install the latest version of <a href="https://oreil.ly/X4dKu">VirtualBox</a>. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="VirtualBox" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657885771824"/>VirtualBox is an application that allows your current computer to act as a VM host system where you may install virtual guests, such as Linux, into a separate, functioning computer system. VirtualBox runs on various host operating systems (OSs) and supports various guest operating systems, including Linux.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="operating systems" data-secondary="host system, running Linux as guest OS" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657885895104"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="guest operating system" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657885812912"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="host operating system" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875716256"/> The host OS and guest OS can be different from one another. Your computer (host OS) can be a Windows, Mac, or Linux-based system but have guest Linux systems installed on it as <span class="keep-together">VirtualBox VMs.</span></p>

<p>When your system boots, you can accept the default settings. If you have experience installing Linux, you can change the default settings to suit your needs. Create a user account when prompted to do so. If your distribution prompts you to give the root account a password, do so. You must remember this password because, without it, you’ll have to reinstall your Linux VM or try to recover it. Installing Linux can take several minutes, and a reboot is required at the<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="installation" data-secondary="installing Linux" data-startref="ix_instl" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875682928"/> end of the installation process. </p>

<p>In the next section, you learn how to interact with your new Linux system at the command line.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Learning the CLI" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="learning_the_cli">
<h1>Learning the CLI</h1>
<p>The <em>command-line interface,</em> or CLI, is how most system administrators interact with their Linux systems because server systems don’t typically have a graphical interface.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="command-line interface" data-see="CLI" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875597744"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CLI (command-line interface)" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_CLI"/> In Microsoft Windows terminology, a CLI-only system, such as a Linux server, would be equivalent to a Windows Server Core system where you only have access to command-line utilities.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, you interact with the Linux system using commands that you enter with a keyboard or <em>standard input</em> (stdin). <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stdin (standard input)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875593104"/>The source from stdin can also be file redirection, programs, and other sources, but in the context of this book, stdin refers to keyboard input unless otherwise noted. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="stdout (standard output)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875669600"/>Many commands are informational and display data about the system or system activities to the screen or <em>standard output</em> (stdout). Sometimes you’ll receive an error from the system known as standard error (stderr). You’ll see the full and abbreviated versions of these terms used interchangeably throughout this text and in other Linux-related documentation that you’ll find elsewhere.</p>
<p>You must learn a few commands to interact successfully with the filesystem.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="filesystems" data-secondary="Linux filesystem" data-tertiary="interaction with, using CLI" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875589520"/> By “learn,” I mean commit to memory rather than looking them up online. There are only a few commands like this, and there are a few options that you should also commit to memory so that your interaction with the system becomes natural and efficient. Don’t worry about harming the system with any command I cover—I’ll warn you when a command should be used carefully.</p>
<p>There are a few things you need to know before jumping into issuing commands. The first is that Linux doesn’t use file extensions. This means that the file <em>filename.exe</em> has no more meaning to Linux than the file <em>Financial_Report.txt</em> or <em>Résumé.doc</em>. They are all files and might not be executable or text files. In Linux, you can name a file almost anything you want to (there are a few limitations), but use whitespace in filenames with caution because doing so requires you to use quotation marks around the filename.</p>
<p>The second thing to know about Linux is that filenames are case-sensitive. In other words, <em>filename.txt</em> and <em>filename.TXT</em> are two different files.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="case sensitivity, filenames in Linux" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875586592"/> I will prove this later in the chapter. For now, take my word for it. The third thing to know is that a file’s permission determines whether you can execute the file, edit the file, or even look at the file’s contents. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="paths (file)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875578512"/>Fourth, every Linux location is uniquely named by its path from the root (<em>/</em>) directory. For example, if you mention the password file in Linux, it’s shown as <em>/etc/passwd</em>. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="absolute path" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875698160"/>This is known as the <em>absolute</em> path and is the standard convention for speaking about or referring to files on the system. Fifth, Linux assumes you know what you want to do and that you’ve spelled everything correctly when you issue a command, so be careful, because some actions are irreversible.</p>
<p>Finally, Linux (like Unix, or more generally “*nix” systems) is not “chatty” like the Windows operating systems are. Linux systems, for example, don’t prompt you with an “Are you sure?” message when you remove (delete) files. Again, the Linux system assumes you want to execute the command you issue if you correctly spell all parts of the command. Spelling counts at the Linux command line.</p>
<p>Navigating the Linux filesystem means exploring the various system directories, learning to return to your home directory, and listing directory contents differently. If you’re a Windows user and you’ve worked at the Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell prompt (PS) on that platform, then the Linux command line will be familiar to you.</p>
<p>The short list of commands in the following sections will acquaint you with the Linux filesystem, files, and the contents of your home directory.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="pwd" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="pwd">
<h2>pwd</h2>
<p>The <code>pwd</code> (print working directory) command <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pwd (print working directory) command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875596960"/>displays where you are on the filesystem.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CLI (command-line interface)" data-secondary="pwd command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875560624"/> If you type the <code>pwd</code> command now, followed by the Enter key, the command responds with <code>/home/<em>your_login_name</em></code>. Always ensure that you press the Enter key after each command so that you can receive a response:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">

</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="cd" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="cd">
<h2>cd</h2>
<p>The <code>cd</code> (change directory, or current directory) command places you into a new directory, returns you to your home directory, and moves you to a higher level or a subdirectory. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CLI (command-line interface)" data-secondary="cd command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875549776"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="cd (change directory) command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875591408"/>The <code>cd</code> command is analogous to the Windows <code>cd</code> command:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ cd /etc
$ pwd
/etc</pre>
<p>Simply entering <code>cd</code> returns you to your home directory regardless of where you are on the filesystem, as demonstrated here:<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="home directory (/home)" data-secondary="returning to, with cd command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875543488"/></p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">

<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ cd /usr/bin</pre>
<p>You can <code>cd</code> to a subdirectory without the absolute path if you’re currently in the parent directory:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/student1
$ cd /usr
$ cd bin

<p>The <code>cd</code> command is one that you’ll use every time that you connect to a Linux system.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="ls" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="ls">
<h2>ls</h2>
<p>The <code>ls</code> (list) command displays a list of files and directories within the location you specify. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="ls (list) command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875531424"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CLI (command-line interface)" data-secondary="ls command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875530784"/>If you don’t specify a location, <code>ls</code> displays the list of files and directories in your <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="list command" data-see="ls command" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875529824"/>current directory:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ cd

$ ls</pre>
<p>You have no visible files in your home directory yet because you haven’t created any and none exist by default. However, you can list files from other directories by specifying the absolute path to the directory list you wish to see. There are too many files to list here in the /usr/bin directory, so I’ve truncated it to these few:</p>
<pre class="pagebreak-after" data-type="programlisting">

<p>There are files in your home directory, but they’re hidden because of the way they’re named. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hidden files and directories" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875564672"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary=".

<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ ls -a
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  .gnupg  .zshrc</pre>
<p>Your listing might vary slightly from this, but understand that all directories and files whose names begin with a period are hidden from standard file lists using the <code>ls</code> command with no options.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="directories" data-secondary="and subdirectories" data-secondary-sortas="subdirectories" data-tertiary="cd into hidden directories" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875549216"/> You can <code>cd</code> into hidden directories or list files within them:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">
$ ls .gnupg
private-keys-v1.d  pubring.kbx</pre>
<p>The <code>ls</code> command is one you’ll use every time you log into your Linux system and is certainly one that you want to commit to memory. I will use the <code>ls</code> command throughout this book and introduce you to many more options for it along the way. Now that you’ve learned the basics of filesystem navigation, it’s time to cover rebooting and shutting down your system.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CLI (command-line interface)" data-startref="ix_CLI" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657880536976"/></p>

<h1>Starting, Rebooting, and Shutting Down a Linux System</h1>
<p>The most basic tasks facing any Linux sysadmin are starting, restarting, and shutting down a system.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="starting, rebooting, and shutting down a Linux system" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875511088"/> If you have computer experience, you know that powering off a system without issuing a shutdown command is bad. It’s bad because doing so can, for example, corrupt open files, leave open files in an “open” state, disrupt running services, and cause problems with database transaction logs, possibly resulting in data loss.</p>
<p>Proper knowledge of how to start, restart, and shut down a system is of great value to sysadmins.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Starting a System" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="starting_a_system">
<h2>Starting a System</h2>
<p>For physical systems, you press the power button and release it to start a system. This begins the power-on self-test (POST) and boot process. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="boot process" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875524560"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="power-on self-test (POST)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875514960"/>Watching the console during boot is important because the system notifies you and logs any issues as it starts up. Watch the screen for any errors or anomalies along the way. (The worst message you can experience on boot is a “kernel panic,” which will be covered later in the book.) Hopefully, all is well with your system, and the process ends with a login prompt.</p>
<p>The startup process is quite short but can identify systemic problems such as memory, disk, filesystem, and network issues. I’ll cover troubleshooting in a later chapter, but be aware now that you should watch the boot process carefully, noting any problems for later investigation.</p>

<p>Restarting or rebooting a system is a standard sysadmin practice.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="restarting a system" data-seealso="rebooting the system" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875505616"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="rebooting the system" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875499008"/> Although you might read or hear the contrary, there’s nothing wrong with rebooting your system. You should do so regularly for all of the reasons stated in the previous section. Restarting a system clears memory, refreshes connections, and ensures the system is healthy. A good reboot can cure certain nagging problems, such as an application that drains your system’s memory, but only temporarily.</p>
<p>Any issues resolved with a reboot should be investigated more thoroughly after the system is up and stable. Restarting a system allows you to troubleshoot before application problems, logging problems, or network problems place the system back into a state when it requires another reboot.</p>

<h2>Shutting Down a System</h2>
<p>Shutting down means issuing a command that gently and appropriately closes all programs and eventually powers off the system.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="shutting down a system" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657875684832"/> This gentle shutdown also warns shell users that the system is going down so that everyone can save their work and <span class="keep-together">log off.</span></p>
<p>System shutdown should be reserved for hardware maintenance, relocation, or decommissioning. Some enterprise policies require that systems go through a full shutdown once a year to identify hardware issues that might not manifest themselves except through a complete system failure. Technicians and sysadmins usually take this opportunity to perform hardware maintenance or hardware checks at the same time.</p>
