<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Kubernetes is a remarkably powerful technology and has achieved a meteoric rise in popularity.  It has formed the basis for genuine advances in the way we manage software deployments.  API-driven software and distributed systems were well established, if not widely adopted, when Kubernetes emerged.  It delivered excellent renditions of these principles, which are foundational to its success, but it also delivered something else that is vital.  In the recent past, software that autonomously converged on declared, desired state was possible only in giant technology companies with the most talented engineering teams.  Now, highly available, self-healing, autoscaling software deployments are within reach of every organization, thanks to the Kubernetes project.  There is a future in front of us where software systems accept broad, high-level directives from us and execute upon them to deliver desired outcomes by discovering conditions, navigating changing obstacles, and repairing problems without our intervention.  Furthermore, these systems will do it faster and more reliably than we ever could with manual operations.  Kubernetes has brought us all much closer to that future. However, that power and capability comes at the cost of some additional complexity. The desire to share our experiences helping others navigate that complexity is why we decided to write this book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You should read this book if you want to use Kubernetes to build a production-grade application platform.  If you are looking for a book to help you get started with Kubernetes, or a text on how Kubernetes works, this is not the right book.  There is a wealth of information on these subjects in other books, in the official documentation, and in countless blog posts and the source code itself. We recommend pairing the consumption of this book with your own research and testing for the solutions we discuss, so we rarely dive deeply into <em>step-by-step</em> tutorial style examples. We try to cover as much theory as necessary and leave most of the <em>implementation</em> as an exercise to the reader.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Throughout this book, you’ll find guidance in the form of options, tooling, patterns, and practices. It’s important to read this guidance with an understanding of how the authors view the practice of building application platforms. We are engineers and architects who get deployed across many Fortune 500 companies to help them take their platform aspirations from idea to production. We have been using Kubernetes as the foundation for getting there since as early as 2015, when Kubernetes reached <code>1.0</code>. We have tried as much as possible to focus on patterns and philosophy rather than on tools, as new tooling appears quicker than we can write! However, we inevitably have to demonstrate those patterns with the most appropriate tool du jour.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We have had major successes guiding teams through their cloud native journey to completely transform how they build and deliver software. That said, we have also had our doses of failure. A common reason for failure is an organization’s misconception of what Kubernetes will solve for. This is why we dive so deep into the concept early on. Over this time we’ve found several areas to be especially interesting for our customers.  Conversations that help customers get further on their path to production, or even help them define it, have become routine. These conversations became so common that we decided maybe it’s time to write a book!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>While we’ve made this journey to production with organizations time and time again, there is only one key consistency across them. This is that the road <em>never</em> looks the same, no matter how badly we sometimes want it to. With this in mind, we want to set the expectation that if you’re going into this book looking for the “5-step program” for getting to production or the “10 things every Kubernetes user should know,” you’re going to be frustrated. We’re here to talk about the many decision points and the traps we’ve seen, and to back it up with concrete examples and anecdotes when appropriate. Best practices exist but must always be viewed through the lens of pragmatism. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and “It depends” is an entirely valid answer to many of the questions you’ll inevitably confront on the journey.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>That said, we highly encourage you to <em>challenge</em> this book! When working with clients we’re always encouraging them to challenge and augment our guidance. Knowledge is fluid, and we are always updating our approaches based on new features, information, and constraints. You should continue that trend; as the cloud native space continues to evolve, you’ll certainly decide to take alternative roads from what we recommended. We’re here to tell you about the ones we’ve been down so you can weigh our perspective against your own.</p>&#13;
