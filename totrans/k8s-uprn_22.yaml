    built on top of Kubernetes. We have described how to wrap programs up as containers,
    place those containers in Pods, replicate those Pods with ReplicaSets, and roll
    them out with Deployments. We have even described how to deploy stateful and real-world
    applications that collect these objects into a single distributed system. But
    we have not covered how to actually work with such an application in a practical
    way. How can you lay out, share, manage, and update the various configurations
    that make up your application? That is the topic of this chapter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you first begin to explore Kubernetes, as we did in the beginning of this
    book, you generally interact with it imperatively. You run commands like `kubectl
    run` or `kubectl edit` to create and modify Pods or other objects running in your
    cluster. Even when we started exploring how to write and use YAML files, this
    was presented in an ad-hoc manner, as if the file itself is just a way station
    on the road to modifying the state of the cluster. In reality, in a true productionized
    application the opposite should be true.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Rather than viewing the state of the cluster—the data in `etcd`—as the source
    of truth, it is optimal to view the filesystem of YAML objects as the source of
    truth for your application. The API objects deployed into your Kubernetes cluster(s)
    are then a reflection of the truth stored in the filesystem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are numerous reasons why this is the right point of view. The first and
    foremost is that it largely enables you to treat your cluster as if it is immutable
    infrastructure. As we have moved into cloud native architectures, we have become
    increasingly comfortable with the notion that our applications and their containers
    are immutable infrastructure, but treating a cluster as such is less common. And
    yet, the same reasons for moving our applications to immutable infrastructure
    apply to our clusters. If your cluster is a snowflake you made by applying random
    YAML files downloaded from the internet ad hoc, it is as dangerous as a virtual
    machine built from imperative bash scripts.

- en: Additionally, managing the cluster state via the filesystem makes it very easy
    to collaborate with multiple team members. Source-control systems are well understood
    and can easily enable multiple people to edit the state of the cluster simultaneously,
    while making conflicts (and the resolution of those conflicts) clear to everyone.

    idea. But it is clear now that multiple people looking at a piece of code before
    it is committed to an application is a best practice for producing high-quality,
    reliable code.
  prefs: []

    used to deploy those applications. All of the same reasons for reviewing code
    apply directly to application configurations. But when you think about it, it
    is also obvious that code review of these configurations is critical to the reliable
    deployment of services. In our experience, most service outages are self-inflicted
    via unexpected consequences, typos, or other simple mistakes. Ensuring that at
    least two people look at any configuration change significantly decreases the
    probability of such errors.

- en: Once your application source code and your deployment configuration files are
    in source control, one of the most common questions is how these repositories
    relate to one another. Should you use the same repository for application source
    code and configuration? This can work for small projects, but in larger projects
    it often makes sense to separate the two. Even if the same people are responsible
    for both building and deploying the application, the perspectives of the builder
    versus those of the deployer are different enough that this separation of concerns
    makes sense.

    to the production branch long before the feature is ready to ship. This enables
    feature development to stay much more closely aligned with the `HEAD` of a repository,
    and thus you avoid the horrendous merge conflicts of a long-lived branch.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Working behind a feature flag also means that enabling a feature simply involves
    making a configuration change to activate the flag. This makes it very clear what
    changed in the production environment, and very simple to roll back the feature
    activation if it causes problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a feature doesn’t require a binary rollback to an older version of the code that

    out the files in the filesystem. Obviously, filesystems contain hierarchical directories,

    semantic component or layer (for instance, *frontend* or *batch work queue*).

    for defining a class or struct. If grouping the objects together doesn’t form
    a single concept, they probably shouldn’t be in a single file.

  prefs: []

    revisions of your configuration. There are two different approaches that you can
    use with the file and version control systems we’ve outlined here. The first is
    to use tags, branches, and source-control features. This is convenient because
    it maps to the way people manage revisions in source control, and leads to a more
    simplified directory structure. The other option is to clone the configuration
    within the filesystem and use directories for different revisions. This makes
    viewing the configurations simultaneously very straightforward.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    structure does not change from the example in the previous section. When you are
    ready for a release, you place a source-control tag (such as `git tag v1.0`) in
    the configuration source-control system. The tag represents the configuration
    used for that version, and the `HEAD` of source control continues to iterate forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Updating the release configuration is somewhat more complicated, but the approach
    models what you would do in source control. First, you commit the change to the
    `HEAD` of the repository. Then you create a new branch named `v1` at the `v1.0`
    tag. You cherry-pick the desired change onto the release branch (`git cherry-pick
    *<edit>*`), and finally, you tag this branch with the `v1.1` tag to indicate a
    new point release. This approach is illustrated in [Figure 22-1](#fig2201).

    move the `development` tag forward to `HEAD`. Thus, developers can track reasonably

    strive for the environments to be as identical as possible. Variance and drift
    between different environments produces snowflakes and systems that are hard to

    can you really trust the load tests that you ran in the staging environment to
    qualify a release? To ensure that your environments stay as similar as possible,
    it is useful to use parameterized environments. Parameterized environments use
    *templates* for the bulk of their configuration, but they mix in a limited set
    of *parameters* to produce the final configuration. In this way, most of the configuration

- en: To determine the order of regions, it is important to consider the characteristics
    of various regions. For example, you are likely to have high-traffic regions and
    low-traffic regions. Depending on your application, you may have features that
    are more popular in one geographic area than another. All of these characteristics
    should be considered when putting together a release schedule. You likely want
    to begin by rolling out to a low-traffic region. This ensures that any early problems
    you catch are limited to an area of little impact. Though it is not a hard-and-fast
    rule, early problems are often the most severe, since they manifest quickly enough
    to be caught in the first region you roll out to. Thus, minimizing the impact
    of such problems on your customers makes sense. Next, roll out to a high-traffic
    region. Once you have successfully validated that your release works correctly
    via the low-traffic region, validate that it works correctly at scale. The only
    way to do this is to roll it out to a single high-traffic region. When you have
    successfully rolled out to both a low- and a high-traffic region, you may have
    confidence that your application can safely roll out everywhere. However, if there
    are regional variations, you may want to also test slowly across a variety of
    geographies before pushing your release more broadly.

    for every release, no matter how big or how small. Many outages have been caused
    by people accelerating releases, either to fix some other problem or because they
    believed it to be “safe.”

    significant problem that you will likely run into at a medium or large scale is
    having different versions of your application deployed to different regions. This
    can happen for a variety of reasons (such as, because a release has failed, been
    aborted, or had problems in a particular region), and if you don’t track things
    carefully you can rapidly end up with an unmanageable snowflake of different versions
    deployed around the world. Furthermore, as customers inquire about fixes to bugs
    they are experiencing, a common question will become: “Is it deployed yet?”'

    which version is running in which region, as well as alerting, which will fire
    when too many versions of your application are deployed. A best practice is to
    limit the number of active versions to no more than three: one testing, one rolling
    out, and one being replaced by the rollout. Any more active versions than this
    is asking for trouble.'

    the principles at the foundation of organizing your application: relying on the

    relying on feature flags, or gates, to make it easy to incrementally add and remove

    rather than absolute truth. Read the guidance, and find the mix of approaches
    that works best for the particular circumstances of your application. But keep
    in mind that in laying out your application for deployment, you are setting a
    process that you will likely have to live with for years.
