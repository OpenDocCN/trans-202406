  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea for this book came to me after writing my first Electron desktop application.
    Having made a career as a web developer, I was immediately smitten with the possibilities
    of using web technologies to build cross-platform applications. At the same time,
    React, React Native, and GraphQL were all taking off. I sought out resources to
    learn how all of these things fit together, but kept coming up short. This book
    represents the guide that I wished I had.

    single programming language, JavaScript, to build all sorts of applications.

- en: Thanks to all of the wonderful people at O’Reilly, past and present, who have
    been universally welcoming and open to my ideas over the years. I want to particularly
    thank my editor, Angela Rufino, who has given me feedback, encouragement, and
    lots of helpful reminders. I want to also thank Mike Loukides, who has provided
    me with both caffeine and great conversation. Lastly, thanks to Jennifer Pollock,
    for her support and encouragement.

    and benefited. Without the individuals and organizations who have created and
    maintained the many libraries I have written about, this book would not be possible.

- en: Several technical reviewers helped make this book better, ensuring that things
    were accurate. Thank you, Andy Ngom, Brian Sletten, Maximiliano Firtman, and Zeeshan
    Chawdhary. It’s a heck of a code review to undertake and I sincerely appreciate
    their efforts. Special thanks goes to my long-time colleague and friend, Jimmy
    Wilson, who I called in at the 11th hour to review and provide feedback. It was
    a lot to ask, but as with everything he does, he took it on with gusto. This book
    wouldn’t be what it is without his help.

    co-workers throughout my adult life. So many lessons big and small, both technical
    and nontechnical, have come through my time with them. The full list is too long
    for print, but I want to give a shout-out to Elizabeth Bond, John Paul Doguin,
    Marc Esher, Jenn Lassiter, and Jessica Schafer.

    the wonderful sounds of Chuck Johnson, Mary Lattimore, Makaya McCraven, G.S. Schray,
    Sam Wilkes, Hiroshi Yoshimura, and many others.

- en: Finally, I want to thank my wife, Abbey, and my children, Riley, Harrison, and
    Harlow, with whom I sacrificed a lot of time to write this book. Thank you for
    putting up with me while I was locked away in my office—or when I wasn’t, but
    my mind still was. The four of you are the motivation for everything that I do.
