    from traditional development and operations practices. In this chapter, you learn
    the fundamentals of DevOps along with the proven practices, including all of the
    benefits and challenges of developing, testing, and operating cloud native applications.
    Additionally, we cover designing cloud native applications with operations and
    rapid, reliable development processes in mind. Most concepts and patterns explained
    in this chapter are applicable to both containerized services and functions. When
    this is not the case, we explicitly call out the differences.

- en: DevOps is a broad concept that encompasses multiple aspects of collaboration
    and communication between software developers and other IT professionals. The
    easiest way to define DevOps is to talk about its goals. DevOps is intended to
    improve collaboration between development and operations teams throughout the
    entire process of software development, from planning to delivery, to improve
    deployment frequency, achieve faster time to market, lower the failure rate of
    new releases, shorten lead time between fixes, and improve mean time to recovery.

    stands for Collaboration, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing. The CALMS
    model is a method that we can use to assess, analyze, and compare the maturity
    of the DevOps team.
