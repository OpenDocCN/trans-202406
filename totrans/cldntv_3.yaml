- en: 'Application architectures are a result of unique business requirements, which
    makes it difficult to come up with an architectural blueprint that is generally
    applicable. Cloud native applications are no exception to that. A good way to
    approach designing cloud native applications is to consider five key areas when
    starting with the initial design: operational excellence, security, reliability,
    scalability, and cost. From an actual implementation perspective there are certain
    building blocks, patterns, and technologies that are proven to be very useful
    in solving specific problems. Besides discussing these five key areas, this chapter
    also covers the most common architectural building blocks.'

- en: All the major cloud providers offer guidance on how to build applications targeting
    their respective cloud environments. Microsoft Azure has its cloud application
    architecture and cloud patterns guide, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has its well-architected
    framework, and Google offers various guides on how to build cloud native applications.
    Although those guides are more specific to their services offered in each environment,
    you can identify five generally applicable pillars that you should keep in mind
    regardless of the cloud provider you are choosing.
