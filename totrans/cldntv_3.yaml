- en: 'Application architectures are a result of unique business requirements, which
    makes it difficult to come up with an architectural blueprint that is generally
    applicable. Cloud native applications are no exception to that. A good way to
    approach designing cloud native applications is to consider five key areas when
    starting with the initial design: operational excellence, security, reliability,
    scalability, and cost. From an actual implementation perspective there are certain
    building blocks, patterns, and technologies that are proven to be very useful
    in solving specific problems. Besides discussing these five key areas, this chapter
    also covers the most common architectural building blocks.'

  zh: 应用架构是独特业务需求的产物，这使得制定通用适用的架构蓝图变得困难。云原生应用也不例外。设计云原生应用的一个好方法是，在初始设计阶段考虑五个关键领域：运营卓越、安全性、可靠性、可扩展性和成本。从实际实施的角度来看，有一些已被证明在解决特定问题时非常有用的构建模块、模式和技术。除了讨论这五个关键领域外，本章还涵盖了最常见的架构构建模块。

- en: All the major cloud providers offer guidance on how to build applications targeting
    their respective cloud environments. Microsoft Azure has its cloud application
    architecture and cloud patterns guide, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has its well-architected
    framework, and Google offers various guides on how to build cloud native applications.
    Although those guides are more specific to their services offered in each environment,
    you can identify five generally applicable pillars that you should keep in mind
    regardless of the cloud provider you are choosing.
