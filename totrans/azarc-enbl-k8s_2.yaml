    growth of containers within companies continues to increase, so does the number
    of containers companies need to manage.

- en: Many companies come to a point where they need a way to efficiently manage and
    orchestrate containers. Google released Kubernetes as an open source orchestration
    system for containers, and companies have adopted it at such a fast rate that
    it has become the go-to for container orchestration. Along with the rise of Kubernetes
    in the enterprise, major cloud providers have created managed Kubernetes offerings
    on their cloud platforms. Microsoft has created Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
    on the Azure cloud platform.

- en: Before we get into Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes, it’s important to talk about
    AKS and what it is. When Kubernetes clusters are projected into Azure Arc, they
    have some similar functionality to AKS, such as monitoring, Azure Policy, and
    so on. This means that the experience of getting information from and administering
    Kubernetes is simplified.

    and was launched in 2018\. It reduces the management overhead of running your
    own Kubernetes cluster instance. With AKS, you only need to administer the agent
    nodes, as Microsoft manages the Control Plane for you. You get integration with
    many native Azure services, such as:'

    pace. Some of the additions Microsoft has added to AKS to make the Kubernetes
    experience easier and enhanced include Kubernetes resources for viewing/managing
    Kubernetes API objects—such pods, services, namespaces, and so on—right in the
    Azure portal; Dev Spaces for easier client-side integration with Visual Studio
    and VS Code for developers to develop on Kubernetes clusters; and use of managed
    identities for a more secure, hands-off approach to a service account for your
    Kubernetes cluster.

- en: As we discussed previously, many organizations have moved to multicloud. We
    also discussed how managing resources and workloads across many environments and
    clouds is a challenge. Kubernetes is often billed as a technology that can help
    companies avoid vendor lock-in and that provides agility to move between clouds.

- en: While it is true that containerized workloads running on Kubernetes are portable,
    making it easier to run these across on-premises or clouds, doing so and even
    managing specific configurations and workloads across multiple clouds is still
    a hefty challenge for organizations and their IT teams.

- en: With Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes, Microsoft has set out to make the challenge
    of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters—regardless of where they’re running—a
    much smaller headache and to streamline the process. Azure Arc not only mixes
    and matches cloud and VMs, but it also allows you to mix and match Kubernetes
    clusters. At the time of this writing, Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is in public
    preview and is only supported in the Eastern US and Western Europe regions. It
    will be supported in more regions when it releases to general availability.

    to Kubernetes clusters that are running either on-premises or on other cloud providers
    for a unified management experience within the Azure cloud platform. It supports
    most out-of-the-box Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)–certified Kubernetes
    distributions. [Figure 2-1](#fig_1_kubernetes_clusters_across_multiple_clouds_managed)
    shows the various managed Kubernetes cloud offerings that can be managed with
    Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes.
