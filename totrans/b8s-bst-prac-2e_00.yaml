- en: Kubernetes is the de facto standard for cloud native development. It is a powerful
    tool that can make your next application easier to develop, faster to deploy,
    and more reliable to operate. However, unlocking the power of Kubernetes requires
    using it correctly. This book is intended for anyone who is deploying real-world
    applications to Kubernetes and is interested in learning patterns and practices
    they can apply to the applications that they build on top of Kubernetes.

- en: 'Importantly, this book is not an introduction to Kubernetes. We assume that
    you have a basic familiarity with the Kubernetes API and tools, and that you know
    how to create and interact with a Kubernetes cluster. If you are looking to learn
    Kubernetes, there are numerous great resources out there, such as [*Kubernetes:
    Up and Running*](https://oreil.ly/ziNRK) (O’Reilly), that can give you an introduction.'

- en: Instead, this book is a resource for anyone who wants to dive deep on how to
    deploy specific applications and workloads on Kubernetes. It should be useful
    to you whether you are about to deploy your first application onto Kubernetes
    or you’ve been using Kubernetes for years.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Between the four of us, we have significant experience helping a wide variety
    of users deploy their applications onto Kubernetes. Through this experience, we
    have seen where people struggle, and we have helped them find their way to success.
    When sitting down to write this book, we attempted to capture these experiences
    so that many more people could learn by reading the lessons that we learned from
    these real-world experiences. It’s our hope that by committing our experiences
    to writing, we can scale our knowledge and allow you to be successful deploying
    and managing your application on Kubernetes on your own.

- en: Although you might read this book from cover to cover in a single sitting, that
    is not really how we intended you to use it. Instead, we designed this book to
    be a collection of standalone chapters. Each chapter gives a complete overview
    of a particular task that you might need to accomplish with Kubernetes. We expect
    people to dive into the book to learn about a specific topic or interest, and
    then leave the book alone, only to return when a new topic comes up.

- en: Despite this standalone approach, some themes span the book. There are several
    chapters on developing applications on Kubernetes. [Chapter 2](ch02.html#developer_workflows)
    covers developer workflows. [Chapter 5](ch05.html#continuous_integration_testing_and_deployment)
    discusses continuous integration and testing. [Chapter 15](ch15.html#building_higher_level_application_patterns_on_kubernetes)
    covers building higher-level platforms on top of Kubernetes, and [Chapter 16](ch16.html#managing_state_and_stateful_application)
    discusses managing state and stateful applications. In addition to developing
    applications, there are several chapters on operating services in Kubernetes.
    [Chapter 1](ch01.html#setting_up_a_basic_service) covers the setup of a basic
    service, and [Chapter 3](ch03.html#monitoring_and_logging_in_kubernetes) covers
    monitoring and metrics. [Chapter 4](ch04.html#configuration_secrets_and_rbac)
    covers configuration management, while [Chapter 6](ch06.html#versioning_releases_and_rollouts)
    covers versioning and releases. [Chapter 7](ch07.html#worldwide_application_distribution_and_staging)
    covers deploying your application around the world.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also several chapters on cluster management, including [Chapter 8](ch08.html#resource_management)
    on resource management, [Chapter 9](ch09.html#networking_network_security_and_service_mesh)
    on networking, [Chapter 10](ch10.html#pod_and_container_security) on pod security,
    [Chapter 11](ch11.html#policy_and_governance_for_your_cluster) on policy and governance,
    [Chapter 12](ch12.html#managing_multiple_clusters) on managing multiple clusters,
    and [Chapter 17](ch17.html#admission_control_and_authorization) on admission control
    and authorization. Finally, some chapters are truly independent; these cover machine
    learning ([Chapter 14](ch14.html#running_machine_learning_in_kubernetes)) and
    integrating with external services ([Chapter 13](ch13.html#integrating_external_services_and_kubernetes)).

- en: Though it can be useful to read all the chapters before you actually attempt
    the topic in the real world, our primary hope is that you will treat this book
    as a reference. It is intended as a guide as you put these topics to practice
    in the real world.

    tools and patterns as Kubernetes continues to mature and provide best practices.
    These new chapters are [Chapter 18](ch18.html#gitops) on GitOps, [Chapter 19](ch19.html#security)
    on security, [Chapter 20](ch20.html#chaos_testing_load_testing_experiments) on
    chaos testing, and [Chapter 21](ch21.html#implementing_an_operator) on implementing
    an operator.
