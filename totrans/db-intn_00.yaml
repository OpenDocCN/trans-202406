    vast majority of software applications. These applications provide logic and a
    user interface, while database systems take care of data integrity, consistency,
    and redundancy.

- en: Back in 2000, if you were to choose a database, you would have just a few options,
    and most of them would be within the realm of relational databases, so differences
    between them would be relatively small. Of course, this does not mean that all
    databases were completely the same, but their functionality and use cases were
    very similar.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Some of these databases have focused on *horizontal scaling* (scaling *out*)—improving
    performance and increasing capacity by running multiple database instances acting
    as a single logical unit: Gamma Database Machine Project, Teradata, Greenplum,
    Parallel DB2, and many others. Today, horizontal scaling remains one of the most
    important properties that customers expect from databases. This can be explained
    by the rising popularity of cloud-based services. It is often easier to spin up
    a new instance and add it to the cluster than scaling vertically (scaling *up*)
    by moving the database to a larger, more powerful machine. Migrations can be long
    and painful, potentially incurring downtime.'

- en: Around 2010, a new class of *eventually consistent* databases started appearing,
    and terms such as *NoSQL*, and later, *big data* grew in popularity. Over the
    last 15 years, the open source community, large internet companies, and database
    vendors have created so many databases and tools that it’s easy to get lost trying
    to understand use cases, details, and specifics.

- en: The Dynamo paper [[DECANDIA07]](app01.html#DECANDIA07), published by the team
    at Amazon in 2007, had so much impact on the database community that within a
    short period it inspired many variants and implementations. The most prominent
    of them were Apache Cassandra, created at Facebook; Project Voldemort, created
    at LinkedIn; and Riak, created by former Akamai engineers.

    and eventual consistency, we have started seeing more scalable and performant
    databases, able to execute complex queries with stronger consistency guarantees.'

- en: 'In conversations at technical conferences, I often hear the same question:
    “How can I learn more about database internals? I don’t even know where to start.”
    Most of the books on database systems do not go into details of storage engine
    implementation, and cover the access methods, such as B-Trees, on a rather high
    level. There are very few books that cover more recent concepts, such as different
    B-Tree variants and log-structured storage, so I usually recommend reading papers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Everyone who reads papers knows that it’s not that easy: you often lack context,
    the wording might be ambiguous, there’s little or no connection between papers,
    and they’re hard to find. This book contains concise summaries of important database
    systems concepts and can serve as a guide for those who’d like to dig in deeper,
    or as a cheat sheet for those already familiar with these concepts.'

    messaging queue, a container platform, or a task scheduler, you have to read the
    project change-logs and mailing lists to stay in touch with the community and
    be up-to-date with the most recent happenings in the project. Understanding terminology
    and knowing what’s inside will enable you to yield more information from these
    sources and use your tools more productively to troubleshoot, identify, and avoid
    potential risks and bottlenecks. Having an overview and a general understanding
    of how database systems work will help in case something goes wrong. Using this
    knowledge, you’ll be able to form a hypothesis, validate it, find the root cause,
    and present it to other project maintainers.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'We often hear people describing database systems in terms of the concepts and
    algorithms they implement: “This database uses gossip for membership propagation”
    (see [Chapter 12](ch12.html#anti_entropy)), “They have implemented Dynamo,” or
    “This is just like what they’ve described in the Spanner paper” (see [Chapter 13](ch13.html#database_transactions)).
    Or, if you’re discussing the algorithms and data structures, you can hear something
    like “ZAB and Raft have a lot in common” (see [Chapter 14](ch14.html#consensus)),
    “Bw-Trees are like the B-Trees implemented on top of log structured storage” (see
    [Chapter 6](ch06.html#b_trees_ch)), or “They are using sibling pointers like in
    B^(link)-Trees” (see [Chapter 5](ch05.html#transaction_processing)).'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We need abstractions to discuss complex concepts, and we can’t have a discussion
    about terminology every time we start a conversation. Having shortcuts in the
    form of common language helps us to move our attention to other, higher-level
    problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the advantages of learning the fundamental concepts, proofs, and algorithms
    is that they never grow old. Of course, there will always be new ones, but new
    algorithms are often created after finding a flaw or room for improvement in a
    classical one. Knowing the history helps to understand differences and motivation
    better.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Learning about these things is inspiring. You see the variety of algorithms,
    see how our industry was solving one problem after the other, and get to appreciate
    that work. At the same time, learning is rewarding: you can almost feel how multiple
    puzzle pieces move together in your mind to form a full picture that you will
    always be able to share with others.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is neither a book about relational database management systems nor about
    NoSQL ones, but about the algorithms and concepts used in all kinds of database
    systems, with a focus on a *storage engine* and the components responsible for
    *distribution*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some concepts, such as query planning, query optimization, scheduling, the relational
    model, and a few others, are already covered in several great textbooks on database
    systems. Some of these concepts are usually described from the user’s perspective,
    but this book concentrates on the internals. You can find some pointers to useful
    literature in the [Part II Conclusion](afterword02.html#part-2-conclusion) and
    in the chapter summaries. In these books you’re likely to find answers to many
    database-related questions you might have.

    countless blog posts, source code, and the documentation for several open source
    databases. The rule of thumb for whether or not to include a particular concept
    in the book was the question: “Do the people in the database industry and research
    circles talk about this concept?” If the answer was “yes,” I added the concept
    to the long list of things to discuss.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some examples of extensible databases with pluggable components (such
    as [[SCHWARZ86]](app01.html#SCHWARZ86)), but they are rather rare. At the same
    time, there are plenty of examples where databases use pluggable storage. Similarly,
    we rarely hear database vendors talking about query execution, while they are
    very eager to discuss the ways their databases preserve consistency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The most significant distinctions between database systems are concentrated
    around two aspects: how they *store* and how they *distribute* the data. (Other
    subsystems can at times also be of importance, but are not covered here.) The
    book is arranged into parts that discuss the subsystems and components responsible
    for *storage* (Part I) and *distribution* (Part II).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Part I** discusses node-local processes and focuses on the storage engine,
    the central component of the database system and one of the most significant distinctive
    factors. First, we start with the architecture of a database management system
    and present several ways to classify database systems based on the primary storage
    medium and layout.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We continue with storage structures and try to understand how disk-based structures
    are different from in-memory ones, introduce B-Trees, and cover algorithms for
    efficiently maintaining B-Tree structures on disk, including serialization, page
    layout, and on-disk representations. Later, we discuss multiple variants to illustrate
    the power of this concept and the diversity of data structures influenced and
    inspired by B-Trees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Last, we discuss several variants of log-structured storage, commonly used for
    implementing file and storage systems, motivation, and reasons to use them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Part II** is about how to organize multiple nodes into a database cluster.
    We start with the importance of understanding the theoretical concepts for building
    fault-tolerant distributed systems, how distributed systems are different from
    single-node applications, and which problems, constraints, and complications we
    face in a distributed environment.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After that, we dive deep into distributed algorithms. Here, we start with algorithms
    for failure detection, helping to improve performance and stability by noticing
    and reporting failures and avoiding the failed nodes. Since many algorithms discussed
    later in the book rely on understanding the concept of leadership, we introduce
    several algorithms for leader election and discuss their suitability.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As one of the most difficult things in distributed systems is achieving data
    consistency, we discuss concepts of replication, followed by consistency models,
    possible divergence between replicas, and eventual consistency. Since eventually
    consistent systems sometimes rely on anti-entropy for convergence and gossip for
    data dissemination, we discuss several anti-entropy and gossip approaches. Finally,
    we discuss logical consistency in the context of database transactions, and finish
    with consensus algorithms.
