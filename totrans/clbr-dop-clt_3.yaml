  zh: 第三章 结论
- en: More than just a sea change around software development practices, the principles
    and ideas found in devops touch all parts of an organization and can be used even
    by large enterprises or government agencies. Collaboration at both individual
    and team levels is a key element of any devops transformation, but it is just
    one piece of the foundation.

  zh: 不仅仅是软件开发实践上的一次巨大变革，DevOps 中的原则和思想影响组织的各个部分，甚至可以被大型企业或政府机构采用。个人和团队层面的协作是任何DevOps转型的关键元素之一，但它只是基础的一部分。
- en: No matter what the specifics of your organization’s culture or journey might
    look like, the end goal is not to have some fixed number of deploys per day, to
    use a specific open source tool, or to do things simply because other organizations
    have been successful doing them. The end goal is to create and maintain a successful
    organization that solves a problem for your customers. Take the time to proactively
    define your goals and the values and ideas that you want to help you get there,
    regardless of your industry or size. Don’t wait until you find that your implicit
    values have been defined for you and it feels too late to change them.

  zh: 无论您的组织文化或发展历程的具体情况如何，最终目标不是每天部署固定数量的软件版本，使用特定的开源工具，或者仅仅因为其他组织成功而采用某些做法。最终目标是创建并维护一个能为客户解决问题的成功组织。花时间积极定义您的目标、价值观和理念，帮助您实现这些目标，无论您所处的行业或规模如何。不要等到您发现您的隐含价值观已经被定义而感到为时已晚。
- en: Devops is about invitations to be involved in the ongoing change process, gratitude
    for wins that occur in every team within the organization, and explicit rejection
    of bullying behaviors. As with a garden, it takes continued feeding, watering,
    and weeding to nurture the organization toward sustainable growth and business
    success. And just as buying a bouquet of precut flowers cannot be considered gardening,
    buying a tool that claims to be a “devops solution” isn’t devops. It is the ongoing
    work to build and maintain a culture that makes devops truly effective.

  zh: DevOps是关于参与持续变革过程的邀请，对组织内每个团队取得的成功表示感激，并明确拒绝欺凌行为。就像园艺一样，需要持续的施肥、浇水和除草来培育组织，使其朝着可持续增长和业务成功的方向发展。而只买一束预先修剪的花不能被认为是园艺，购买声称是“DevOps解决方案”的工具也不是DevOps。真正有效的DevOps是持续建设和维护文化的工作。
