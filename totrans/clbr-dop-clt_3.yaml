- en: More than just a sea change around software development practices, the principles
    and ideas found in devops touch all parts of an organization and can be used even
    by large enterprises or government agencies. Collaboration at both individual
    and team levels is a key element of any devops transformation, but it is just
    one piece of the foundation.

- en: No matter what the specifics of your organization’s culture or journey might
    look like, the end goal is not to have some fixed number of deploys per day, to
    use a specific open source tool, or to do things simply because other organizations
    have been successful doing them. The end goal is to create and maintain a successful
    organization that solves a problem for your customers. Take the time to proactively
    define your goals and the values and ideas that you want to help you get there,
    regardless of your industry or size. Don’t wait until you find that your implicit
    values have been defined for you and it feels too late to change them.

- en: Devops is about invitations to be involved in the ongoing change process, gratitude
    for wins that occur in every team within the organization, and explicit rejection
    of bullying behaviors. As with a garden, it takes continued feeding, watering,
    and weeding to nurture the organization toward sustainable growth and business
    success. And just as buying a bouquet of precut flowers cannot be considered gardening,
    buying a tool that claims to be a “devops solution” isn’t devops. It is the ongoing
    work to build and maintain a culture that makes devops truly effective.
