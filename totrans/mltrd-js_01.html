<h1 class="calibre12">Preface</h1>


<p class="author1">Bryan and I (Thomas) first met during my interview at the San Francisco branch for DeNA, a Japanese mobile game development company. Apparently most of the upper management was going to say no, but after the two of us hung out at a Node.js meetup later that night, Bryan went and convinced them to give me an offer.</p>

<p class="author1">While at DeNA, Bryan and I worked on writing reusable Node.js modules so that game teams could build out their game servers, combining components as appropriate to suit the needs of their game. Performance was something we were always measuring, and mentoring game teams on performance was a part of the job; our servers were continuously scrutinized by developers in an industry that traditionally relied upon C++.</p>

<p class="author1">The two of us would work together in other capacities as well. Another such role was at a small security startup named Intrinsic where we focused on hardening Node.js apps at such a complete and granular level that I doubt the world will ever see another product like it. Performance tuning was a huge concern for that product as well since customers didn’t want to take a hit to their throughput. We spent many hours running benchmarks, poring over flamegraphs, and digging through internal Node.js code. Had the worker threads module been available in all the versions of Node.js that our customers demanded, I have no doubt we would have incorporated it into the product.</p>

<p class="author1">We’ve also worked together in nonemployment capacities as well. <a href="https://oreil.ly/TNS5w" class="calibre6">NodeSchool SF</a> is one such example wherein we both volunteered to teach others how to use JavaScript and create Node.js programs. We have also spoken at many of the same conferences and meetups.</p>

<p class="author1">Both of your authors have a passion for JavaScript and Node.js, and for teaching them to others and eliminating misconceptions. When we realized there was such an extreme lack of documentation about building multithreaded JavaScript applications, we knew what we had to do. This book was born from our desire to not only educate others about the capabilities of JavaScript, but also to help prove that platforms like Node.js are just as capable as any other when it comes to building performant services that utilize the available hardware.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Target Audience" class="calibre4"><div class="preface" id="idm45995932895704">
<h1 class="calibre13">Target Audience</h1>

<p class="author1">The ideal reader of this book is an engineer who has been writing JavaScript for a few years, and who doesn’t necessarily have experience with writing multithreaded applications or even experience with more traditionally multithreaded languages like C++ or Java. We do include some example C application code, as a sort of multithreaded lingua franca, but it’s not something that the reader is expected to be familiar with or even understand.</p>

<p class="author1">If you do have experience with such languages, that’s great, and this book will help you understand the JavaScript equivalent to the functionality provided by whatever language you may be familiar with. On the other hand, if you’ve only written code using JavaScript, then this book is also for you. We include information across multiple layers of learning; this includes both low-level API references, high-level patterns, and plenty of technical tangents in between to help fill in any gaps.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Goals" class="calibre4"><div class="preface" id="idm45995932891800">
<h1 class="calibre13">Goals</h1>

<p class="author1">Perhaps the most exuberant goal of this book is to bring knowledge to the community that it’s possible to build multithreaded applications using JavaScript. Traditionally, JavaScript code was constrained to a single core, and indeed there are many Twitter threads and forum posts describing the language as such. With a title like <em class="calibre7">Multithreaded JavaScript</em>, we hope to completely dispel the notion that JavaScript applications are confined to a single core.</p>

<p class="author1">At a more concrete level, the goal is to teach you, the reader, several aspects about writing multithreaded JavaScript applications. By the time you’re done reading this book you’ll understand the various web worker APIs provided in browsers, their strengths and weaknesses, and when to use which. As far as Node.js goes, you’ll understand the worker threads module and how its APIs compare to those in the browser.</p>

<p class="author1">The book focuses on two approaches to building multithreaded applications: one using message passing and the other using shared memory. By reading this book you’ll understand the APIs used to implement each, when you might want to use one approach or the other, and in which situations they can be combined—and you’ll even get your hands dirty with some high-level patterns built upon these approaches.</p>
