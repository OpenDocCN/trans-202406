<h1>History of JavaScript</h1>

<p>JavaScript <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="history of" id="idm45584704836416"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="history" data-secondary="of JavaScript" id="idm45584704835408"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Eich, Brendan" id="idm45584704834464"/>was designed in 10 days by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 to be approachable and easy to use for websites.
Developers have been poking fun at its quirks and perceived shortcomings ever since.
I’ll cover some of them in the next section.</p>

<p>JavaScript has evolved tremendously since 1995, though!
Its steering committee, TC39, has released new versions of <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TC39" id="idm45584704833152"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ECMAScript" data-secondary="new versions" id="idm45584704832448"/>ECMAScript—the language specification that JavaScript is based on—yearly since 2015 with new features that bring it in line with other modern languages.
Impressively, even with regular new language versions, JavaScript has managed to maintain backward compatibility for decades in varying environments, including browsers, embedded applications, and server runtimes.</p>

<p>Today, JavaScript is a wonderfully flexible language with a lot of strengths.
One should appreciate that while JavaScript has its quirks, it’s also helped enable the incredible growth of web applications and the<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Hejlsberg, Anders" id="idm45584704830992"/> internet.</p>

<p>Developers <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="limitations of" id="javascript-disadvantage"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="vanilla" id="idm45584707501872"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="vanilla JavaScript" id="idm45584707500928"/>often refer to using JavaScript without any significant language extensions or frameworks as “vanilla”: referring to it being the familiar, original flavor.
I’ll soon go over why TypeScript adds just the right flavor to overcome these particular major pitfalls, but it’s useful to understand just why they can be painful.
All these weaknesses become more pronounced the larger and longer-lived a project gets.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Costly Freedom"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584707500000">
<h2>Costly Freedom</h2>

<p>Many <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="freedom" data-secondary="in JavaScript" id="idm45584707498464"/>developers’ biggest gripe with JavaScript is unfortunately one of its key features: JavaScript provides virtually no restrictions in how you structure your code.
That freedom makes it a ton of fun to start a project in JavaScript!</p>

<p>As you get to have more and more files, though, it becomes apparent how that freedom can be damaging.
Take the following snippet, presented out of context from some fictional painting application:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="js"><code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">paintPainting</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">painter</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">painting</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
  <code class="k">return</code> <code class="nx">painter</code>
    <code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">prepare</code><code class="p">()</code>
    <code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">paint</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">painting</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">painter</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">ownMaterials</code><code class="p">)</code>
    <code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">finish</code><code class="p">();</code>
<code class="p">}</code></pre>

<p>Reading that code without any context, you can only have vague ideas on how to call the <code>paintPainting</code> function.
Perhaps if you’ve worked in the surrounding codebase you may recall that <code>painter</code> should be what’s returned by some <code>getPainter</code> function.
You might even make a lucky guess that <code>painting</code> is a string.</p>

<p>Even if those assumptions are correct, though, later changes to the code may invalidate them.
Perhaps <code>painting</code> is changed from a string to some other data type, or maybe one or more of the painter’s methods are renamed.</p>

<p>Other languages might refuse to let you run code if their compiler determines it would likely crash.
Not so with<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dynamically typed languages" id="idm45584703315680"/> dynamically typed languages—those that run code without checking if it will likely crash first—such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>The freedom of code that makes JavaScript so fun becomes a real pain when you want safety in running your code.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Loose Documentation"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584706878592">
<h2>Loose Documentation</h2>

<p>Nothing<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="documentation" data-secondary="in JavaScript" id="docs-javascript"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JSDoc" id="jsdoc"/> exists in the JavaScript language specification to formalize describing what function parameters, function returns, variables, or other constructs in code are meant to be.
Many developers have adopted a standard called JSDoc to describe functions and variables using block comments.
The JSDoc standard describes how you might write documentation comments placed directly above constructs such as functions and variables, formatted in a standard way.
Here’s an example, again taken out of context:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="js"><code class="cm">/**</code>
<code class="cm"> * Performs a painter painting a particular painting.</code>
<code class="cm"> *</code>
<code class="cm"> * @param {Painting} painter</code>
<code class="cm"> * @param {string} painting</code>
<code class="cm"> * @returns {boolean} Whether the painter painted the painting.</code>
<code class="cm"> */</code>
<code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">paintPainting</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">painter</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">painting</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code> <code class="cm">/* ... */</code> <code class="p">}</code></pre>

<p>JSDoc has key issues that often make it unpleasant to use in a large codebase:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Nothing stops JSDoc descriptions from being wrong about code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if your JSDoc descriptions were previously correct, during code refactors it can be difficult to find all the now-invalid JSDoc comments related to your changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Describing complex objects is unwieldy and verbose, requiring multiple standalone comments to define types and their relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Maintaining JSDoc comments across a dozen files doesn’t take up too much time, but across hundreds or even thousands of constantly updating files can be a real chore.</p>
</div></section>













<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Weaker Developer Tooling"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584704716032">
<h2>Weaker Developer Tooling</h2>

<p>Because <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="developer tools" data-secondary="for JavaScript" data-secondary-sortas="JavaScript" id="idm45584704714736"/>JavaScript doesn’t provide built-in ways to identify types, and code easily diverges from JSDoc comments, it can be difficult to automate large changes to or gain insights about a codebase.
JavaScript developers are often surprised to see features in typed languages such as C# and Java that allow developers to perform class member renamings or jump to the place an argument’s type was declared.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>You may protest that modern IDEs such as VS Code do provide some development tools such as automated refactors to JavaScript.
True, but: they use TypeScript or an equivalent under the hood for many of their JavaScript features, and those development tools are not as reliable or as powerful in most JavaScript code as they are in well-defined TypeScript <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="limitations of" data-startref="javascript-disadvantage" id="idm45584707269904"/>code.</p>

<h1>Getting Started in the TypeScript Playground</h1>

<p>You’ve<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="Playground" id="typescript-playground"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Playground" id="playground"/> read a good amount about TypeScript by now.
Let’s get you writing it!</p>

<p>The main TypeScript website includes a “Playground” editor at <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play"><em class="hyperlink">https://www.typescriptlang.org/play</em></a>.
You can type code into the main editor and see many of the same editor suggestions you would see when working with TypeScript locally in a full IDE (Integrated Development Environment).</p>

<p>Most of the snippets in this book are intentionally small and self-contained enough that you could type them out in the Playground and tinker with them for fun.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="TypeScript in Action"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584707302944">
<h2>TypeScript in Action</h2>

<p>Take a <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="type checking in" id="typescript-typecheck"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="type checking" data-secondary="in TypeScript" id="typecheck-typescript"/>look at this code snippet:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ts"><code class="kr">const</code> <code class="nx">firstName</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"Georgia"</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="kr">const</code> <code class="nx">nameLength</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">firstName</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">length</code><code class="p">();</code>
<code class="c1">//                           ~~~~~~</code>
<code class="c1">// This expression is not callable.</code></pre>

<p>The code is written in normal JavaScript syntax—I haven’t introduced TypeScript-specific syntax yet.
If you were to run the TypeScript type checker on this code, it would use its knowledge that the <code>length</code> property of a string is a number—not a function—to give you the complaint shown in the comment.</p>

<p>If you were to paste that code into the playground or an editor, it would be told by the language service to give you a little red squiggly under <code>length</code> indicating TypeScript’s displeasure with your code.
Hovering over the squigglied code would give you the text of the complaint (<a data-type="xref" href="#string_length_not_callable">Figure 1-1</a>).</p>

<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-1. </span>TypeScript reporting an error on string length not being callable</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Being told of these simple errors in your editor as you type them is a lot more pleasant than waiting until a particular line of code happens to be run and throw an error.
If you tried to run that code in JavaScript, it would <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="type checking in" data-startref="typescript-typecheck" id="idm45584705872704"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="type checking" data-secondary="in TypeScript" data-startref="typecheck-typescript" id="idm45584705871456"/>crash!</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Freedom Through Restriction"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584707302640">
<h2>Freedom Through Restriction</h2>

<p>TypeScript <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="freedom" data-secondary="in TypeScript" id="idm45584705829840"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="freedom and restrictions" id="idm45584705828832"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="restrictions in TypeScript" id="idm45584705827920"/>allows us to specify what types of values may be provided for parameters and variables.
Some developers find having to explicitly write out in your code how particular areas are supposed to work to be restrictive at first.</p>

<p>But!
I would argue that being “restricted” in this way is actually a good thing!
By restricting our code to only being able to be used in the ways you specify, TypeScript can give you confidence that changes in one area of code won’t break other areas of code that use it.</p>

<p>If, say, you change the number of required parameters for a function, TypeScript will let you know if you forget to update a place that calls the function.</p>

<p>In the following example, <code>sayMyName</code> was changed from taking in two parameters to taking one parameter, but the call to it with two strings wasn’t updated and so is triggering a TypeScript complaint:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ts" class="less_space pagebreak-before"><code class="c1">// Previously: sayMyName(firstName, lastNameName) { ...</code>
<code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">sayMyName</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">fullName</code><code class="p">)</code> <code class="p">{</code>
  <code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">log</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="sb">`You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me </code><code class="si">${</code><code class="nx">fullName</code><code class="si">}</code><code class="sb">`</code><code class="p">);</code>
<code class="p">}</code>

<code class="nx">sayMyName</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"Beyoncé"</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="s2">"Knowles"</code><code class="p">);</code>
<code class="c1">//                   ~~~~~~~~~</code>
<code class="c1">// Expected 1 argument, but got 2.</code></pre>

<p>That code would run without crashing in JavaScript, but its output would be different from expected (it wouldn’t include <code>"Knowles"</code>):</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="text">You acting kind of shady, ain't callin' me Beyoncé</pre>

<p>Calling functions with the wrong number of arguments is exactly the sort of short-sighted JavaScript freedom that TypeScript restricts.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Precise Documentation"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584702427552">
<h2>Precise Documentation</h2>

<p>Let’s <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="documentation" id="typescript-docs"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="documentation" data-secondary="in TypeScript" id="docs-typescript"/>look at a TypeScript-ified version of the <code>paintPainting</code> function from earlier.
Although I haven’t yet gone over the specifics of TypeScript syntax for documenting types, the following snippet still hints at the great precision with which TypeScript can document code:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ts"><code class="kr">interface</code> <code class="nx">Painter</code> <code class="p">{</code>
  <code class="nx">finish</code><code class="p">()</code><code class="o">:</code> <code class="kr">boolean</code><code class="p">;</code>
  <code class="nx">ownMaterials</code>: <code class="nx">Material</code><code class="p">[];</code>
  <code class="nx">paint</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">painting</code>: <code class="nx">string</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">materials</code>: <code class="nx">Material</code><code class="p">[])</code><code class="o">:</code> <code class="kr">boolean</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="p">}</code>

<code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">paintPainting</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">painter</code>: <code class="nx">Painter</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">painting</code>: <code class="nx">string</code><code class="p">)</code><code class="o">:</code> <code class="kr">boolean</code> <code class="p">{</code> <code class="cm">/* ... */</code> <code class="p">}</code></pre>

<p>A TypeScript developer reading this code for the first time could understand that <code>painter</code> has at least three properties, two of which are methods.
By baking in syntax to describe the “shapes” of objects, TypeScript provides an excellent, enforced system for describing how objects look.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Stronger Developer Tooling"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584705606224">
<h2>Stronger Developer Tooling</h2>

They can then use those insights to surface intelligent suggestions as you type.
These suggestions can be incredibly useful for development.</p>

<p>If you’ve used VS Code to write JavaScript before, you might have noticed that it suggests “autocompletions” as you write code with built-in types of objects like strings.
If, say, you start typing the member of something known to be a string, TypeScript can suggest all the members of the strings (<a data-type="xref" href="#javascript_autocomplete">Figure 1-2</a>).</p>

</div></figure>

<p>When you add TypeScript’s type checker for understanding code, it can give you these useful suggestions even for code you’ve written.
Upon typing <code>painter.</code> in the <code>paintPainting</code> function, TypeScript would take its knowledge that the <code>painter</code> parameter is of type <code>Painter</code> and the <code>Painter</code> type has the following members (<a data-type="xref" href="#typescript_painter_dropdown">Figure 1-3</a>).</p>

I’ll cover them in <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch13.xhtml#configuration_options">Chapter 13, “Configuration Options”</a>.
The important feature is that now you can run <code>tsc</code> to tell TypeScript to compile all the files in that folder and TypeScript will refer to that <em>tsconfig.json</em> for any configuration options.</p>

<p>Try adding a file named <em>index.ts</em> with the following contents:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="ts"><code class="nx">console</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">blub</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s2">"Nothing is worth more than laughter."</code><code class="p">);</code></pre>

<p>Then, run <code>tsc</code> and provide it the name of <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tsc command" data-startref="tsc" id="idm45584693955216"/>that <em>index.ts</em> file:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting" data-code-language="shell">tsc index.ts</pre>

<p>You should get an error that looks roughly like:</p>

<pre data-type="programlisting">index.ts:1:9 - error TS2339: Property 'blub' does not exist on type 'Console'.

1 console.blub("Nothing is worth more than laughter.");
          ~~~~

Found 1 error.</pre>

<p>Indeed, <code>blub</code> does not exist on the <code>console</code>.
What was I thinking?</p>

<p>Before you fix the code to appease TypeScript, note that <code>tsc</code> created an <em>index.js</em> for you with contents including the <code>console.blub</code>.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>This<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="type errors" id="idm45584693926192"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="syntax validity, type errors and" id="idm45584693925456"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compilers" data-secondary="error handling" id="idm45584693924816"/> is an important concept: even though there was a <em>type error</em> in our code, the <em>syntax</em> was still completely valid.
The TypeScript compiler will still produce JavaScript from an input file regardless of any type errors.</p>
</div>

<p>Correct the code in <em>index.ts</em> to call <code>console.log</code> and run <code>tsc</code> again.
There should be no complaints in your terminal, and the <em>index.js</em> file should now contain updated output<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="running locally" data-startref="typescript-runlocal" id="idm45584693902144"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="running" data-secondary="TypeScript locally" data-startref="run-typescript-local" id="idm45584693900896"/> code:</p>

<p>I highly recommend playing with the book’s snippets as you read through them, either in the playground or in an editor with TypeScript support, meaning it runs the TypeScript language service for you.
Small self-contained exercises, as well as larger projects, are also available to help you practice what you’ve learned on

<h2>Editor Features</h2>

<p>Another<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="editor features" id="typescript-editor"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="editor features (TypeScript)" id="editor-typescript"/> benefit of creating a <em>tsconfig.json</em> file is that when editors are opened to a particular folder, they will now recognize that folder as a TypeScript project.
For example, if you open VS Code in a folder, the settings it uses to analyze your TypeScript code will respect whatever’s in that folder’s <em>tsconfig.json</em>.</p>

<p>As an exercise, go back through the code snippets in this chapter and type them in your editor.
You should see drop-downs suggesting completions for names as you type them, especially for members such as the <code>log</code> on <code>console</code>.</p>

<p>Very exciting: you’re using the TypeScript language service to help yourself write code!
You’re on your way to being a TypeScript developer!</p>
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>VS Code <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="VS Code" data-secondary="TypeScript support in" id="idm45584693868400"/>comes with great TypeScript support and is itself built in TypeScript.
You don’t <em>have</em> to use it for TypeScript—virtually all modern editors have excellent TypeScript support either built-in or available via plugins—but I do recommend it for at least trying out TypeScript while reading through this book.
If you do use a different editor, I also recommend enabling its TypeScript support.
I’ll cover editor features more deeply in <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch12.xhtml#using_ide_features">Chapter 12, “Using IDE Features”</a>.</p>

<h1>What TypeScript Is Not</h1>

<p>Now that <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="limitations of" id="typescript-limits"/>you’ve seen how wonderful TypeScript is, I have to warn you about some limitations.
Every tool excels at some areas and has limitations in others.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="A Remedy for Bad Code"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584693842656">
<h2>A Remedy for Bad Code</h2>

<p>TypeScript <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="code style in TypeScript" id="idm45584693841280"/>helps you structure your JavaScript, but other than enforcing type safety, it doesn’t enforce any opinions on what that structure should look like.</p>

<p>Good!</p>

<p>TypeScript is a language that everyone is meant to be able to use, not an opinionated framework with a target audience.
You can write code using whatever architectural patterns you’re used to from JavaScript, and TypeScript will support them.</p>

<p>If anybody tries to tell you that TypeScript forces you to use classes, or makes it hard to write good code, or whatever code style complaints are out there, give them a stern look and tell them to pick up a copy of <em>Learning TypeScript</em>.
TypeScript does not enforce code style opinions such as whether to use classes or functions, nor is it associated with any particular application framework—Angular, React, etc.—over others.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Extensions to JavaScript (Mostly)"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584693838880">
<h2>Extensions to JavaScript (Mostly)</h2>

<p>TypeScript’s <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="relationship with TypeScript" id="javascript-typescript-relationship"/>design goals explicitly state that it should:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Align with current and future ECMAScript proposals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preserve runtime behavior of all JavaScript code</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>TypeScript does not try to change how JavaScript works at all.
Its creators have tried very hard to avoid adding new code features that would add to or conflict with JavaScript.
Such a task is the domain of TC39, the technical committee that works on ECMAScript itself.</p>

<p>There are a few older features in TypeScript that were added many years ago to reflect common use cases in JavaScript code.
Most of those features are either relatively uncommon or have fallen out of favor, and are only covered briefly in <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch14.xhtml#syntax_extensions">Chapter 14, “Syntax Extensions”</a>.
I recommend staying away from them in most cases.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>As of 2022, TC39 is <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TC39" id="idm45584693831616"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="type annotations" id="idm45584693831008"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="type annotations" data-secondary="in JavaScript" data-secondary-sortas="JavaScript" id="idm45584693830160"/>investigating adding a syntax for type annotations to JavaScript.
The latest proposals have them acting as a form of comments that do not impact code at runtime and are used only for development-time systems such as TypeScript.
It will be many years until type comments or some equivalent are added to JavaScript, so they won’t be mentioned elsewhere in this book.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Slower Than JavaScript"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584693828688">
<h2>Slower Than JavaScript</h2>

<p>Sometimes <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="speed compared to JavaScript" id="idm45584693827552"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="speed compared to TypeScript" id="idm45584693826704"/>on the internet, you might hear some opinionated developers complain that TypeScript is slower than JavaScript at runtime.
That claim is generally inaccurate and misleading.
The only changes TypeScript makes to code are if you ask it to compile your code down to earlier versions of JavaScript to support older runtime environments such as Internet Explorer 11.
Many production frameworks don’t use TypeScript’s compiler at all, instead using a separate tool for transpilation (the part of compiling that converts source code from one programming language into another) and TypeScript only for type checking.</p>

<p>TypeScript does, however, add some time to building your code.
TypeScript code must be compiled down to JavaScript before most environments, such as browsers and Node.js, will run it.
Most build pipelines are generally set up so that the performance hit is negligible, and slower TypeScript features such as analyzing code for likely mistakes are done separately from generating runnable application code files.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>Even projects that seemingly allow running TypeScript code directly, such as ts-node and Deno, themselves internally convert TypeScript code to JavaScript before running it.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Finished Evolving"><div class="sect2" id="idm45584693824080">
<h2>Finished Evolving</h2>

<p>The web <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="constant changes in" id="idm45584693822944"/>is nowhere near finished evolving, and thus neither is TypeScript.
The TypeScript language is constantly receiving bug fixes and feature additions to match the ever-shifting needs of the web community.
The basic tenets of TypeScript you’ll learn in this book will remain about the same, but error messages, fancier features, and editor integrations will improve over time.</p>

<p>In fact, while this edition of the book was published with TypeScript version 4.7.2 as the latest, by the time you started reading it, we can be certain a newer version has been released.
Some of the TypeScript error messages in this book might even already be <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="TypeScript" data-secondary="limitations of" data-startref="typescript-limits" id="idm45584693821584"/>out of date!</p>
