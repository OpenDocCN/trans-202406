- en: This book contains a collection of code that we’ve found helpful over several
    years of building React applications. Like recipes you would use in the kitchen,
    we’ve designed them to be starting points or inspirations for your own code. You
    should adjust them to match your situation and replace any ingredients (such as
    example servers) with those that seem more appropriate for your needs. The recipes
    range from general web development tips to larger pieces of code that you could
    generalize into libraries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the recipes are built with Create React App, as this is now the common
    starting point for most React projects. It should be straightforward to convert
    each recipe for use in Preact or Gatsby.

- en: To keep the code compact, we have generally used hooks and functions rather
    than class components. We have also used the Prettier tool to apply standard code
    formatting throughout. We have used Prettier’s default options, other than narrower
    indents and line lengths, to fit the code neatly onto the printed page. You should
    adjust the code format to match your preferred standard.
