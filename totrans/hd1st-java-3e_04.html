That’s not exactly object-oriented. In fact, that’s not object-oriented at all.  Well, we did use a few objects, like the String arrays for the Phrase-O-Matic, but we didn’t actually develop any of our own object types.  So now we’ve got to leave that procedural world behind, get the heck out of main(), and start making some objects of our own.  We’ll look at what makes object-oriented (OO) development in Java so much fun.  We’ll look at the difference between a class and an object.  We’ll look at how objects can give you a better life (at least the programming part of your life.  Not much we can do about your fashion sense).

Laura, the procedural programmer, and Brad, the OO developer, both knew this would be a piece of cake.</p>
<p>Laura, sitting at her (non-adjustable) desk, thought to herself, “What are the things this program has to <em>do</em>? What <strong><em>procedures</em></strong> do we need?” And she answered herself, “<strong>rotate</strong> and <strong>playSound</strong>.” So off she went to build the procedures. After all, what <em>is</em> a program if not a pile of procedures?</p>
<p>Brad, meanwhile, kicked back at the coffee shop and thought to himself, “What are the <strong><em>things</em></strong> in this program...who are the key <em>players</em>?” He first thought of <strong>The Shapes</strong>. Of course, there were other things he thought of like the User, the Sound, and the Clicking Event. But he already had a library of code for those pieces, so he focused on building Shapes. Read on to see how Brad and Laura built their programs, and for the answer to your burning question, <strong><em>“So, who got the Aeron and the desk?”</em></strong></p>

<p>“OK, <em>technically</em> you were first, Laura,” said the Manager, “but we have to add just one tiny thing to the program. It’ll be no problem for crack programmers like you two.”</p>
<p><em>“If I had a dime for every time I’ve heard that one,”</em> thought Laura, knowing that spec-change-no-problem was a fantasy. <em>“And yet Brad looks strangely serene.

<p>The rotate procedure would still work; the code used a lookup table to match a shapeNum to an actual shape graphic. But <strong><em>playSound would have to change.</em></strong></p>

<p>Brad smiled, sipped his fruit frappe, and <em>wrote one new class</em>. Sometimes the thing he loved most about OO was that he didn’t have to touch code he’d already tested and delivered. “Flexibility, extensibility, ...” he mused, reflecting on the benefits of OO.</p>

So much for that foofy OO nonsense.) But the smirk on Laura’s face melted when the Really Annoying Project Manager said (with that tone of disappointment), “Oh, no, <em>that’s</em> not how the amoeba is supposed to rotate...”</p>
<p>Turns out, both programmers had written their rotate code like this:</p>
<p><strong>1. determine the rectangle that surrounds the shape.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. calculate the center of that rectangle, and rotate the shape around that point.</strong></p>

<p>“I’m toast,” thought Laura, visualizing charred Wonderbread™. “Although, hmmmm. I could just add another if/else to the rotate procedure and then just hard-code the rotation point code for the amoeba. That probably won’t break anything.” But the little voice at the back of her head said, <em>“Big Mistake. Do you honestly think the spec won’t change again?”</em></p>

<p>Without missing a beat, Brad modified the rotate <strong>method</strong>, but only in the Amoeba class. <strong><em>He never touched the tested, working, compiled code</em></strong> for the other parts of the program. To give the Amoeba a rotation point, he added an <strong>attribute</strong> that all Amoebas would have. He modified, tested, and delivered (via free festival WiFi) the revised program during a single Bela Fleck set.</p>

And, since she was sure that if she got the chair and desk, she’d also be next in line for a promotion, she had to turn this thing around.</p>
<p><strong>LAURA:</strong> You’ve got duplicated code! The rotate procedure is in all four Shape things.</p>
<p><strong>BRAD:</strong> It’s a <strong><em>method</em></strong>, not a <em>procedure</em>. And they’re <strong><em>classes</em></strong>, not <em>things</em>.</p>
<p><strong>LAURA:</strong> Whatever. It’s a stupid design. You have to maintain <em>four</em> different rotate “methods.” How can that ever be good?</p>
<p><strong>BRAD:</strong> Oh, I guess you didn’t see the final design. Let me show you how OO <strong>inheritance</strong> works, Laura.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img src="Images/f0031-02.png" alt="image" width="1007" height="705"/>

</div></figure>
<p>You can read this as, <strong>“Square inherits from Shape,” “Circle inherits from Shape</strong>,” and so on. I removed rotate() and playSound() from the other shapes, so now there’s only one copy to maintain.</p>
<p>The Shape class is called the <strong>superclass</strong> of the other four classes. The other four are the <strong>subclasses</strong> of Shape. The subclasses inherit the methods of the superclass. In other words, <em>if the Shape class has the functionality, then the subclasses automatically get that same functionality.</em></p>

<p><strong>BRAD:</strong> <strong>Method.</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAURA:</strong> Whatever. How can Amoeba do something different if it “inherits” its functionality from the Shape class?</p>
<p><strong>BRAD:</strong> That’s the last step. The Amoeba class <strong>overrides</strong> the methods of the Shape class. Then at runtime, the JVM knows exactly which rotate() method to run when someone tells the Amoeba to rotate.</p>

<p><strong>LAURA:</strong> How do you “tell” an Amoeba to do something? Don’t you have to call the procedure, sorry—<em>method</em>, and then tell it <em>which</em> thing to rotate?</p>
<p><strong>BRAD:</strong> That’s the really cool thing about OO. When it’s time for, say, the triangle to rotate, the program code invokes (calls) the rotate() method <em>on the triangle object</em>. The rest of the program really doesn’t know or care <em>how</em> the triangle does it. And when you need to add something new to the program, you just write a new class for the new object type, so the <strong>new objects will have their own behavior.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Time to pump some neurons.</strong></p>
<p>You just read a story about a procedural programmer going head-to-head with an OO programmer. You got a quick overview of some key OO concepts including classes, methods, and attributes.  We’ll spend the rest of the chapter looking at classes and objects (we’ll return to inheritance and overriding in later chapters).</p>
<p>Based on what you’ve seen so far (and what you may know from a previous OO language you’ve worked with), take a moment to think about these questions:</p>
<p>What are the fundamental things you need to think about when you design a Java class?  What are the questions you need to ask yourself? If you could design a checklist to use when you’re designing a class, what would be on the checklist?</p>

<p>Things an object <strong><em>knows</em></strong> about itself are called <strong>instance variables.</strong> They represent an object’s state (the data) and can have unique values for each object of that type.</p>
<p><strong>Think of instance as another way of saying object.</strong></p>
<p>Things an object can <strong><em>do</em></strong> are called <strong>methods</strong>. When you design a class, you think about the data an object will need to know about itself, and you also design the methods that operate on that data. It’s common for an object to have methods that read or write the values of the instance variables. For example, Alarm objects have an instance variable to hold the alarmTime, and two methods for getting and setting the alarmTime.</p>
<p>So objects have instance variables and methods, but those instance variables and methods are designed as part of the class.</p>

You need <em>two</em> classes. One class for the type of object you want to use (Dog, AlarmClock, Television, etc.) and another class to <em>test</em> your new class. The <em>tester</em> class is where you put the main method, and in that main() method you create and access objects of your new class type. The tester class has only one job: to <em>try out</em> the methods and variables of your new object.</p>
<p>From this point forward in the book, you’ll see two classes in many of our examples. One will be the <em>real</em> class—the class whose objects we really want to use, and the other class will be the <em>tester</em> class, which we call <em>&lt;WhateverYourClassNameIs&gt;</em> <code><strong>TestDrive</strong></code>. For example, if we make a <code><strong>Bungee</strong></code> class, we’ll need a <code><strong>BungeeTestDrive</strong></code> class as well. Only the <em>&lt;SomeClassName&gt;</em><code><strong>TestDrive</strong></code> class will have a main() method, and its sole purpose is to create objects of your new class (the not-the-tester class), and then use the dot operator (.) to access the methods and variables of the new objects. This will all be made stunningly clear by the following examples. No, <em>really.</em></p>

<h2>The two uses of main:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>to <strong>test</strong> your real class</p></li>
<li><p>to <strong>launch/start</strong> your <strong>Java application</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>A real Java application is nothing but objects talking to other objects. In this case, <em>talking</em> means objects calling methods on one another. On the previous page, and in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#how_objects_behave_methods_use_instance">Chapter 4</a>, <em>How Objects Behave</em>, we look at using a main() method from a separate TestDrive class to create and test the methods and variables of another class. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#using_the_java_library_get_to_know_the_j">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Using the Java Library</em>, we look at using a class with a main() method to start the ball rolling on a <em>real</em> Java application (by making objects and then turning those objects loose to interact with other objects, etc.)</p>
<p>As a “sneak preview,” though, of how a real Java application might behave, here’s a little example. Because we’re still at the earliest stages of learning Java, we’re working with a small toolkit, so you’ll find this program a little clunky and inefficient. You might want to think about what you could do to improve it, and in later chapters that’s exactly what we’ll do. Don’t worry if some of the code is confusing; the key point of this example is that objects talk to objects.</p>

<h2>The Guessing Game</h2>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The Guessing Game involves a game object and three player objects. The game generates a random number between 0 and 9, and the three player objects try to guess it. (We didn’t say it was a really <em>exciting</em> game.)</p>
<p><strong>Classes:</strong></p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">  GuessGame.class   Player.class   GameLauncher.class</pre>
<p><strong>The Logic:</strong></p>
<p>1. The GameLauncher class is where the application starts; it has the main() method.</p>
<p>2. In the main() method, a GuessGame object is created, and its startGame() method is called.</p>
<p>3. The GuessGame object’s startGame() method is where the entire game plays out. It creates three players and then “thinks” of a random number (the target for the players to guess). It then asks each player to guess, checks the result, and either prints out information about the winning player(s) or asks them to guess again.</p>

All objects—no matter when, where, or how they’re created—live on the heap. But it’s not just any old memory heap; the Java heap is actually called the <strong>Garbage-Collectible Heap</strong>. When you create an object, Java allocates memory space on the heap according to how much that particular object needs. An object with, say, 15 instance variables, will probably need more space than an object with only two instance variables. But what happens when you need to reclaim that space? How do you get an object out of the heap when you’re done with it? Java manages that memory for you! When the JVM can “see” that an object can never be used again, that object becomes <em>eligible for garbage collection.</em> And if you’re running low on memory, the Garbage Collector will run, throw out the unreachable objects, and free up the space so that the space can be reused. In later chapters you’ll learn more about how this works.</p>

How do I do that if everything has to go in a class?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There isn’t a concept of “global” variables and methods in a Java OO program. In practical use, however, there are times when you want a method (or a constant) to be available to any code running in any part of your program. Think of the <code>random()</code> method in the Phrase-O-Matic app; it’s a method that should be callable from anywhere. Or what about a constant like <em>pi</em>? You’ll learn in <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.xhtml#numbers_matter_numbers_and_statics">Chapter 10</a> that marking a method as <code>public</code> and <code>static</code> makes it behave much like a “global.” Any code, in any class of your application, can access a public static method. And if you mark a variable as <code>public</code>, <code>static</code>, and <code>final</code>, you have essentially made a globally available <em>constant</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Then how is this object-oriented if you can still make global functions and global data?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> First of all, everything in Java goes in a class. So the constant for <em>pi</em> and the method for <code>random()</code>, although both public and static, are defined within the <code>Math</code> class.  And you must keep in mind that these static (global-like) things are the exception rather than the rule in Java. They represent a very special case, where you don’t have multiple instances/objects.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What <em>is</em> a Java program? What do you actually <em>deliver?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> A Java program is a pile of classes (or at least <em>one</em> class). In a Java application, <em>one</em> of the classes must have a main method, used to start up the program. So as a programmer, you write one or more classes. And those classes are what you deliver. If the end user doesn’t have a JVM, then you’ll also need to include that with your application’s classes so that they can run your program. There are a number of programs that let you bundle your classes with a JVM and create a folder or file you can share however you want (e.g., via the internet). Then the end user can install the correct version of the JVM (assuming they don’t already have it on their machine).</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I have a hundred classes? Or a thousand? Isn’t that a big pain to deliver all those individual files? Can I bundle them into one <em>Application Thing?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, it would be a big pain to deliver a huge bunch of individual files to your end users, but you won’t have to. You can put all of your application files into a <strong>J</strong>ava <strong>AR</strong>chive—<em>a<strong>.jar</strong> file</em>—that’s based on the pkzip format.  In the jar file, you can include a simple text file formatted as something called a <code>manifest</code>, that defines which class in that jar holds the <code>main()</code> method that should run.</p>
