<h1><span class="label">Chapter 2. </span>“Pattern”-ity Testing, Proto-Patterns, 
<span class="keep-together">and the Rule of Three</span></h1>


<p>From the moment a new pattern is proposed to its potential widespread adoption, a pattern may have to go through multiple rounds of deep inspection by the design community and software developers. This chapter talks about this journey of a newly introduced “proto-pattern” through a “pattern”-ity test until it is eventually recognized as a pattern if it meets the <em>rule of three</em>.</p>

<p>This and the next chapter explore the approach to structuring, writing, presenting, and reviewing nascent design patterns. If you’d prefer to learn established design patterns first, you can skip these two chapters for the time being.</p>

<h1>What Are Proto-Patterns?</h1>

<p>Remember that not every algorithm, <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="about" id="idm45017718336144"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="about" id="idm45017718334896"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="proto-patterns" data-secondary="about" id="idm45017718333680"/>best practice, or solution represents what might be considered a complete pattern. There may be a few key ingredients missing, and the pattern community is generally wary of something claiming to be one without an extensive and critical evaluation. Even if something is presented to us which <em>appears</em> to meet the criteria for a pattern, we should not consider it as one until it has undergone suitable periods of scrutiny and testing by others.</p>

<p>Looking back upon Alexander’s work once more,<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Alexander, Christopher" id="idm45017718331648"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patterns" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="process and thing" id="idm45017718330944"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="about patterns" data-tertiary="process and thing" id="idm45017718329728"/> he claims that a pattern should be both a process and a “thing.” This definition is obtuse as he follows by saying that it is the process that should create the “thing.” This is why patterns generally focus on addressing a visually identifiable structure; we should be able to visually depict (or draw) a picture representing the structure resulting from placing the pattern into practice.</p>

<h1>The “Pattern” Tests</h1>

<p>You may often come across the<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="defined" id="idm45017718326592"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="defined" id="idm45017716491552"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="proto-patterns" data-secondary="defined" id="idm45017716490336"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="tests of “pattern”-ity" id="idm45017716489392"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="tests of “pattern”-ity" id="idm45017716488160"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="proto-patterns" data-secondary="tests of “pattern”-ity" id="idm45017716486928"/> term “proto-pattern” when studying design patterns. What is this? Well, a pattern that has not yet conclusively passed the “pattern”-ity tests is usually referred to as a proto-pattern. Proto-patterns may result from the work of someone who has established a particular solution worthy of sharing with 
<span class="keep-together">the community.</span> However, due to its relatively young age, the community has not had the opportunity to vet the proposed solution suitably.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the individual(s) sharing the pattern may not have the time or interest in going through the “pattern”-ity  process and might <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patlets" id="idm45017716484608"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="patlets" id="idm45017716483904"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="patlets" id="idm45017716482688"/>release a short description of their proto-pattern instead. Brief descriptions or snippets of this type of pattern are known as <em>patlets</em>.</p>

<p>The work involved in comprehensively documenting a qualified pattern can be pretty daunting. Looking back at some of the earliest work in the field of design patterns, a pattern may be considered “good” if it does the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Solves a particular problem</dt>
<dd>
<p>Patterns are not supposed to just capture principles or strategies. They need to capture solutions. This is one of the most essential ingredients of a good pattern.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Does not have an obvious solution</dt>
<dd>
<p>We can find that problem-solving techniques often attempt to derive from well-known first principles. The best design patterns usually provide solutions to issues indirectly—this is considered a necessary approach for the most challenging problems related to design.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Describes a proven concept</dt>
<dd>
<p>Design patterns require proof that they function as described, and without this proof, the design cannot be seriously considered. If a pattern is highly speculative in nature, only the brave will attempt to use it.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Describes a relationship</dt>
<dd>
<p>In some cases, it may appear that a pattern describes a type of module. Despite what the implementation looks like, the official description of the pattern must describe much deeper system structures and mechanisms that explain its relationship to code.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>We would be forgiven for thinking that a proto-pattern that fails to meet guidelines isn’t worth learning from; however, this is far from the truth. Many proto-patterns are actually quite good. I am not saying that all proto-patterns are worth looking at, but there are quite a few useful ones in the wild that could assist us with future projects. Use your best judgment with the above list in mind, and you’ll be fine in your selection process.</p>

<h1>Rule of Three</h1>

<p>One of the additional requirements<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="rule of three" id="idm45017717951104"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="proto-patterns" data-tertiary="rule of three" id="idm45017717949856"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="proto-patterns" data-secondary="tests of “pattern”-ity" data-tertiary="rule of three" id="idm45017717948640"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="rule of three" id="idm45017717947360"/> for a pattern to be valid is that it displays some recurring phenomenon. You can often qualify this in at least three key areas, referred to as the rule of three. To show recurrence using this rule, one must demonstrate the following:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Fitness of purpose</dt>
<dd>
<p>How is the pattern considered successful?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Usefulness</dt>
<dd>
<p>Why is the pattern considered successful?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Applicability</dt>
<dd>
<p>Is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has broader applicability? If so, this needs to be explained. When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is vital to keep these areas in mind.</p>
