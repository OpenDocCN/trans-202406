- en: Docker is a tool for running applications within containers on a particular
    machine. It is used throughout this book for running various databases, third-party
    services, and even applications that you write. Docker maintains an [Install Docker
    Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) page, but the instructions for
    macOS and Linux have been repeated here for your reference.

    Mac. This will provide you with not only the Docker daemon and CLI tools, but
    it will also provide you with a GUI tool that runs in your menu bar. Visit the
    [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/)
    page and download the stable disk image, then go through the usual macOS installation
    process.

    The script supports several distros like Ubuntu and CentOS. It’ll also install
    the necessary packages from the Docker repository to your local machine. When
