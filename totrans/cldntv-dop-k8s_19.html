<p>There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.</p>&#13;

<p>Well, that was quite a ride. We hope this book has served you as a good road map for your journey and gives you confidence to take the next steps with Kubernetes, whatever that looks like for you.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>They say an expert is just somebody who’s one page ahead in the manual. It’s quite possible that, if you’re reading this book, you are the current Kubernetes expert for your organization, at least for now. We hope you’ll continue to find this book useful as a source to refer back to often, but it’s also only just a starting point.</p>&#13;

<h1>Second Edition Notes</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A common observation about Kubernetes in the past few years is that it is becoming “boring,” and we think that is a very good thing. “Boring” in this context also means “reliable” and “predictable.” Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem around it have continued to mature and stabilize. This allows software organizations to make better plans around their future infrastructure investments, and hire engineers who have experience using these standard tools.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Remember, Kubernetes is just a tool. It is certainly an exciting tool, but the real excitement should be focused around what we can go out and <em>do</em> with Kubernetes. The goal is to build excellent things that do good in the world and help solve problems for people.</p>&#13;

<p>Your first priority on your Kubernetes journey should be to spread your expertise as widely as you can—and to learn as much as you can from others. None of us knows everything, but everybody knows something. Together, we just might figure things out.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="less_space pagebreak-before">And don’t be afraid to experiment. Make your own demo app, or borrow ours, and try things with it that you’re likely to need in production. If everything you do works perfectly, then you’re not experimenting enough. Real learning comes from failures, and from trying to figure out what’s wrong and fix them. The more you fail, the more you learn.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To the extent that <em>we’ve</em> learned anything about Kubernetes, it’s because we’ve failed a lot. We hope you will too. Have fun!</p>&#13;
