    in 2018\. Vue is a popular framework within the developer community, thanks to
    its ease of use and flexibility. If you are looking for a great tool to build
    and ship excellent performant web applications to end users, Vue.js is the answer.

    tools you need for your Vue.js development environment. It also explores helpful
    tools that make your Vue.js development process more manageable. By the end of
    the chapter, you will have a working environment with a simple Vue.js application
    ready to start your journey in learning Vue.js.

    progressive, composable, and reactive *user interfaces* (UI) in frontend applications.

- en: Vue is written on top of JavaScript and offers an organized mechanism to structure
    and build a web application. It also acts as the trans-compiler (*transpiler*)
    that compiles and translates Vue code (as a Single File Component, which we will
    discuss further in [“Vue Single File Component Structure”](ch03.html#sfc)) into
    equivalent HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in build time before deploying. In a
    standalone mode (with a generated script file), the Vue engine performs the code
    translation at run-time instead.

- en: Vue follows the MVVM (*Model–View–ViewModel*) pattern. Unlike [MVC (*Model–View–Controller*)](https://oreil.ly/GHu2u),^([1](ch01.html#id387))
    the ViewModel is the binder that binds data between the View and Model. Allowing
    direct communication for the view and model progressively enables the component’s
    reactivity.

    events in your application.

    is a substantial aspect of the application’s performance, especially the initial
    loading time on delivery. At the time of writing, Vue stands as the fastest and
    most lightweight framework (~10kB in size). This advantage results in less time-consuming
    downloading and better run-time performance from a browser perspective.
