<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="community" data-secondary="contributing to Falco" data-type="indexterm" id="ch15.html0"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="contributing to Falco" data-type="indexterm" id="ch15.html1"/>Reaching this point in the book means you’re on your way to mastering all aspects of Falco. This chapter will give you some advice on contributing to The Falco Project. Contributing means much more than just writing code (a common misconception)—in fact, there are many valuable ways to contribute. We’ll explain where to start and how to satisfy the Falcosecurity organization’s specific contribution requirements.</p>
<p>Contributing to open source software is a rewarding experience. Not only will you improve Falco, but you’ll also meet people with similar interests, share feedback and ideas with others, and improve your own skills. If you are new to open source or want to learn more, we suggest taking a look at the <a href="https://oreil.ly/ZBe39">Open Source Guides</a>.</p>

<h1>What Does It Mean to Contribute to Falco?</h1>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220511056"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220509856"/>Falco is a <a href="https://www.cncf.io">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> project. The CNCF serves as a vendor-neutral place for cloud native software. It empowers self-governing models for its hosted projects and helps sustain healthy open source communities. Falco is primarily driven by its community, which includes users, maintainers, and developers who curate and continuously improve it by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sharing feedback to improve the design and existing features</p></li>
<li><p>Testing Falco to discover issues</p></li>
<li><p>Reporting bugs</p></li>
<li><p>Writing project documentation</p></li>
<li><p>Experimenting with new ideas</p></li>
<li class="pagebreak-after"><p>Test-driving new features</p></li>
<li class="less_space"><p>Proposing changes</p></li>
<li><p>Writing code</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on. In summary, contributing means sharing knowledge and collaborating for the benefit of The Falco Project.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Where Should I Start?"><div class="sect1" id="where_should_i_startquestion_mark">
<h1>Where Should I Start?</h1>
<p>You should start by joining the Falco community. You can do that by joining the <a href="https://oreil.ly/00Az6">Falco Slack channel</a> and introducing yourself. The community is very welcoming. We recommend subscribing to the <a href="https://oreil.ly/R5CSB">official mailing list</a>. Community members, including maintainers, also get together in a weekly call, which everyone can join. You can find details about the weekly community call and other initiatives in the <a href="https://oreil.ly/VMhp4">community GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>As a friendly reminder, the community is made up of human beings: be kind with them, and they will do the same with you. Everyone participating in the community must adhere to its <a href="https://oreil.ly/GgbyC">Code of Conduct</a>, so make sure you read and understand it.</p>

Each project has its own public repository—you can even find a repository with the <a href="https://oreil.ly/47j3K">source code of the Falco website</a>. If you don’t have a GitHub account yet, you’ll need to <a href="https://oreil.ly/F61GW">create one</a>. We also advise you to take your time and get familiar with how GitHub works. You’ll need a working knowledge of Git, particularly if you plan to contribute code.</p>
<p>The Falcosecurity organization has an automated support mechanism (or bot) to help you and make the contribution process easier. You will probably need a bit of time to get acquainted with it. If you need help, feel free to ask! An actual human from the community will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>Before preparing any contribution, make sure to check out the <a href="https://oreil.ly/yRema">online contribution guidelines</a>, since they change from time to time. However, keep reading and we will explain the most important aspects.</p>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Issues"><div class="sect2" id="issues">
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Falcosecurity projects" data-secondary="GitHub" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220483840"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="GitHub issues" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220482464"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="issues (GitHub)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220481360"/><a href="https://oreil.ly/cOTct">GitHub issues</a> are the main way to interact with a project. Opening an issue to report a bug or propose an enhancement is one of the principal forms of contribution. Using issues correctly is also vital for the project, since most feedback comes from them.</p>
<p>Each Falcosecurity repository defines <em>kinds</em> of issues. The most common kinds are <em>Bug Report</em>, <em>Documentation Request</em>, <em>Failing Test</em>, and <em>Feature Request</em>. You select the kind when opening an issue. Depending on the kind you select, you will see an issue description along with a form for you to fill out. The form usually includes questions: for example, it might ask you to describe a bug, how to reproduce it, the Falco version that presents the bug, and so on. This information helps others understand your issue and work on it, so it’s crucial to answer all of the questions to save everyone time and increase the chances of successful resolution.</p>
<p>Once an issue has been opened, a collaborative process starts. Any community members interested in the topic can participate, not just maintainers. Participating in this process is a welcome way to get involved.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="triaging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220476176"/>The initial stage of this process is called <em>triaging</em>. It involves verifying and categorizing the information reported in the issue. For example, in the case of a bug, community members try to reproduce it and check if it appears in the manner described. In some cases, the process ends with someone correctly answering a question or simply pointing the reporter to resources that solve the problem. In other cases, someone volunteers to implement a requested feature or fix a bug and takes ownership of submitting a <em>pull request</em> (see the next section).</p>
<p>You can be involved at any stage of this process. As long as it is constructive, everyone can contribute.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Pull Requests"><div class="sect2" id="pull_requests">
<h2>Pull Requests</h2>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Falcosecurity projects" data-secondary="pull requests" data-type="indexterm" id="ch15.html5"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pull requests (PRs)" data-type="indexterm" id="ch15.html6"/><a href="https://oreil.ly/bcerI">Pull requests (PRs)</a> are the only way to commit changes to a Falcosecurity project. When you want to submit a new feature or a fix, you have to <a href="https://oreil.ly/yfuIq">fork the related repository</a>, create a branch in your fork, and add your commits. Once you’re confident your change works as expected, you are ready to submit a PR. Similar to issues, PRs come with a predefined <a href="https://oreil.ly/zqqJL">template</a> to fill out. Be sure to read the instructions carefully. The template also includes some commands to help you interact with the automation.</p>
<p>After you open a PR, you will need to wait for a maintainer to review it. Maintainers have a lot of ongoing issues and PRs to look at, so be patient if they do not reply quickly! They might approve the PR directly or ask you to change something in your code. The review process is collaborative: maintainers and the PR author (and sometimes other users) share feedback and comments until the PR gets approved and merged. Any time you’re in doubt, ask for support: the maintainers will explain how to proceed.</p>
<p>There are a few general guidelines to follow when making a PR:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each repository may have its own coding style and guidelines; make sure you read and understand them.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid proposing too many code changes in a single PR; submitting several smaller, self-contained PRs usually works better.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers highly recommend using the <a href="https://oreil.ly/BB160">Conventional Commits style</a> in your Git commit messages.</p></li>
<li><p>You must sign off on all of your Git commits, and your PR must not include merge commits (which we’ll discuss in a moment).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following subsections explain the main requirements you must satisfy when preparing your code using Git.</p>
<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Git conflict resolution and linear history"><div class="sect3" id="git_conflict_resolution_and_linear_hist">
<h3>Git conflict resolution and linear history</h3>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pull requests (PRs)" data-secondary="Git conflict resolution/linear history" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220459440"/>Sometimes you may need to synchronize with the upstream (remote) branch when working on your PR. If the remote branch has diverged from your local one, conflicts might arise. Git allows you to synchronize and resolve conflicts by <em>merging</em> or <em>rebasing</em>. Both methods solve the same problem, but they produce different outcomes.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="merging" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220456768"/>Merging happens when the histories of the local and remote branches have diverged, and you use the <code>git merge</code> command or the <code>git pull</code> command to reconcile nonlinear histories. However, merging has the drawback of not leaving the repository history clean, making it harder to navigate with commands like <code>git bisect</code> or <code>git log</code>. For these reasons, the Falcosecurity organization does not allow merging in its projects.</p>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="rebasing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220453104"/>In contrast, <em>rebasing</em> moves your commits, placing them on top of the history of the other branch (instead of introducing a merge commit). That ensures the Git history is always linear. When developing your PR, you must always use rebasing to synchronize with the upstream or resolve conflicts with the main branch. The following command works in both cases (replace <code><em>&lt;branch&gt;</em></code> with the name of the remote branch):</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ <strong>git fetch origin</strong>
$ <strong>git rebase -i origin/</strong><em>&lt;branch&gt;</em></pre>
<p>This command also removes merge commits if you have accidentally introduced them. You can use its shortened version, <code>git pull --rebase</code>, when you only need to pull changes from your remote branch (for example, when working with collaborators on the same branch).</p>
<p>To reiterate: the Falcosecurity organization enforces a linear history and does not allow merge commits for any projects. If your PR has a merge commit, the automation will block the PR and maintainers will not be able to merge it until you fix the issue. Always use rebasing, or your changes will not be accepted.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="The Developer Certificate of Origin"><div class="sect3" id="the_developer_certificate_of_origin">
<h3>The Developer Certificate of Origin</h3>
<p><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220445696"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220444528"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="pull requests (PRs)" data-secondary="Developer Certificate of Origin" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220443408"/>In 2004, the Linux Foundation (the parent organization of the CNCF) introduced the <a href="https://oreil.ly/Qttlz">Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)</a>, a lightweight way for contributors to state that they have written (or have the right to submit) a piece of code. Projects that enforce the DCO require contributors to sign off on their commits, indicating that they agree to the DCO’s terms for that single contribution. The Git CLI has an embedded sign-off functionality that you can use via the <a href="https://oreil.ly/5VcWl"><code>-s</code> option</a> or by manually adding the following line to the commit message:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">Signed-off-by: <em>Full Name &lt;example@example.net&gt;</em></pre>
<p>The line must follow this format and include your name and email address.</p>
<p>As part of the CNCF, Falco and all its related projects require the DCO. The Falco­se⁠curity organization implements an automation mechanism to check the DCO on PRs. When it is missing in a commit, the automation blocks the PR. So, don’t forget to sign off on every single commit; otherwise, maintainers cannot accept your contributions.</p>
<p>If you submit a PR and the DCO check fails because you missed signing off on one or more commits, don’t worry. You can adjust it. If you just need to amend the last commit, use<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch15.html6" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220437344"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch15.html5" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220435968"/>:<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch15.html4" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220434464"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch15.html3" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220433056"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="" data-startref="ch15.html2" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45324220431680"/></p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ <strong>git commit --amend --signoff</strong>
$ <strong>git push --force-with-lease</strong></pre>
<p>If you need to fix all the commits in your PR, use:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">$ <strong>git rebase --signoff origin</strong>
$ <strong>git push --force-with-lease</strong></pre>
