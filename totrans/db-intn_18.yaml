    The storage engine and node-local read-write path can have a larger impact on
    *performance* of the system: how quickly it can process requests locally. At the
    same time, a subsystem responsible for communication in the cluster often has
    a larger impact on the *scalability* of the database system: maximum cluster size
    and capacity. However, the storage engine can only be used for a limited number
    of use cases if it’s not scalable and its performance degrades as the dataset
    grows. At the same time, putting a slow atomic commit protocol on top of the fastest
    storage engine will not yield good results.'

    have to be considered holistically. When designing a database system, you have
    to consider how different subsystems fit and work together.

    single-node applications, and which difficulties are to be expected in such environments.

    and other important infrastructure software. Using the knowledge from this book,
    you’ll be able to better understand how they work, which, in turn, will help to
    make better decisions about which software to use, and identify potential problems.
