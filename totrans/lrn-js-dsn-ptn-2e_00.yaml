- en: The world of JavaScript has come a long way since I wrote the first edition
    of *Learning JavaScript Design Patterns* over 10 years ago. At that time, I was
    working on large-scale web applications and found that the lack of structure and
    organization in JavaScript code made it difficult to maintain and scale those
    applications.

- en: Fast forward to today, and the web development landscape has changed dramatically.
    JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world
    and is used for everything from simple scripts to complex web applications. The
    JavaScript language has evolved to include modules, promises, and `async`/`await`,
    which has heavily influenced how we architect applications. The way developers
    write components, such as with React, has also significantly impacted how they
    think about maintainability. This has resulted in the need for modern patterns
    that take these new changes into account.

- en: With the rise of modern libraries and frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular,
    developers are now building applications that are more complex than ever before.
    I recognized the need for an updated version of *Learning JavaScript Design Patterns*
    to reflect the changes in JavaScript and web application development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this second edition of *Learning JavaScript Design Patterns*, I aim to help
    developers apply modern design patterns to their JavaScript code and React applications.
    The book covers more than 20 design patterns essential for building maintainable
    and scalable applications. The book is not just about design patterns but also
    about rendering and performance patterns, which are critical to the success of
    modern web applications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first edition of this book focused on classical design patterns, such as
    the Module pattern, the Observer pattern, and the Mediator pattern. These patterns
    are still important and relevant today, but the web development world has evolved
    significantly in the past decade, and new patterns have emerged. This new edition
    covers these new patterns, such as promises, `async`/`await`, and the newer variations
    of the Module pattern. We also cover architectural patterns such as MVC, MVP,
    and MVVM and discuss where modern frameworks fit with these architectural patterns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Today’s developers are exposed to many library-specific or framework-specific
    design patterns. React’s matured ecosystem and utilization of newer JS primitives
    provide an excellent launchpad to talk about best practices and patterns in the
    framework or library context. In addition to classic design patterns, this book
    covers modern React patterns, such as Hooks, Higher-Order Components, and Render
    Props. These patterns are specific to React and essential for building modern
    web applications using this popular framework.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is not just about patterns; it’s also about best practices. We cover
    topics such as code organization, performance, and rendering, which are crucial
    for building high-quality web applications. You will learn about dynamic imports,
    code-splitting, server-side rendering, hydration, and Islands architecture, all
    of which are essential for building fast and responsive web applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the end of this book, you will have a deep understanding of design patterns
    and how to apply them to your JavaScript code and React applications. You will
    also know which patterns are relevant to the modern web and which are not. This
    book is not just a reference for patterns; it’s also a guide to building high-quality
    web applications. You will learn how to structure your code for maximum maintainability
    and scalability and how to optimize your code for performance.
