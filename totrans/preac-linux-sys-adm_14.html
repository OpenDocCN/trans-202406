<h1><span class="label">Chapter 14. </span>Continuing Your Education</h1>
<p>It doesn’t matter how technical you are. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_edu"/>You must continue learning throughout your career. And if you’re certified, many certifications require some continuing education units (CEUs) per year that you must document and submit to the certifying authority.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="continuing education units (CEUs)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872177360"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="CEUs (continuing education units)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871716704"/> But continuing your education involves more than just gathering certifications and collecting CEUs yearly to maintain those certifications. Continuing your education means expanding your horizons, learning something new, and enhancing your skills as a technologist.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="continuing your education" data-see="education, continuing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872175072"/></p>
<p>This chapter focuses on educational opportunities, including internal corporate training, certification training, independent study, and community college and university classes.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Training Internally" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="training_internally">
<h1>Training Internally</h1>
<p>Often, the least expensive and most accessible training is that which your company produces, conducts, or hosts.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="training internally" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871697520"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="training internally" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871696880"/> I’m not referring to those annual refresher courses we must take to satisfy regulatory requirements. I’m referring to technical résumé-building classes that enhance your skills and knowledge. Internal training is either training that your company develops and delivers to employees or training that your company purchases and delivers on-premises. The delivery method depends on many factors, such as cost, instructor availability, time, and other logistical <span class="keep-together">considerations.</span></p>
<p>There is a downside to internal training, and it’s that the training occurs on-site. Yes, one of the advantages is also a disadvantage. When you train at your local facility, you risk having users, colleagues, or your manager interrupt your training to have you fix something that will “only take a minute.” These disruptions and interruptions, while possibly necessary, are detrimental to your learning. You miss valuable information, demonstrations, and lessons that are often difficult to go back and pick up on your own. Personally, every on-premises class I’ve taken has been interrupted by support calls. My managers always reminded me that “training is a privilege” and “the job comes first” when I requested dedicated time for training. Be prepared for your training to be interrupted or even discontinued due to the requirements of your job.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Seeking Certification" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="seeking_certification">
<h1>Seeking Certification</h1>
<p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was an industry-wide effort to get technical people certified. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="seeking certification" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872746224"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="certifications" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871687360"/>However, many certification classes focused so much on teaching test answers that the learning was thin, and experienced technical folks considered certifications to have little value. Certification gets a bad rap because of this trend. Professionals offended by the number of freshly certified IT people then began to seek “higher level” certifications such as Cisco’s CCNA, CCNE, and others because they were perceived as legitimate, while those from other vendors weren’t.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to present day, and IT certifications are still a thing; certain certifications are still considered more legitimate and worthy than others. A good example is the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872746352"/> This high-level certification has become so popular that an entire industry is now built around it. There are courses, study guides, boot camps, exam pass guarantees, cram sessions, hundreds of books, and more. When the industry becomes saturated with this certification, which was once very highly regarded, a new contender for everyone’s attention and money will rise up to replace it as the next big certification to earn.</p>
<p>Certifications can be valuable, but I have reservations about jumping onto a trend that’s likely to die out as quickly as it appeared. You should seek time- and job-tested certifications that offer value for your current job or the job you want.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Preparing for a Certification Exam" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="preparing_for_a_certification_exam">
<h2>Preparing for a Certification Exam</h2>
<p>I’ve heard that “experience is the best teacher,” but experienced professionals can still fail expensive certification exams. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="seeking certification" data-tertiary="preparing for certification exam" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871840128"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="certifications" data-secondary="preparing for certification exam" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871659392"/>Do yourself a favor and prepare for the exam regardless of your level of expertise, experience, or job duties. Exams have a way of wording questions that can confuse or mislead the most experienced professionals. Don’t take the exam lightly, and don’t assume that you already know everything. Certification exams are serious business.</p>
<p>Hundreds of books and other preparation materials are available for free or at a reasonable cost. You should take practice exams to learn how exam question writers phrase scenarios. Most exams are scenario-based. This means that you have to be able to <em>apply</em> your knowledge and not just remember facts. Remembering facts will help you with some questions, but you must read a scenario and decide based on your options. And the scenarios and questions are rarely straightforward. My best advice is to use at least two different study sources by different authors to have a range of perspectives and practice questions written by multiple authors.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Taking the Exam" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="taking_the_exam">
<h2>Taking the Exam</h2>
<p>On the day of your exam, arrive at the testing center a little early so you can sign in, calm down, use the restroom, and get into a test-taking mindset. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="seeking certification" data-tertiary="taking the exam" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657873708944"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="certifications" data-secondary="taking the exam" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657873715216"/>The test proctor will escort you into the exam room, which is sometimes private but can be a room where multiple people are also taking exams. Before entering the exam room, the proctor will have you empty your pockets, remove your jacket, and surrender your cell phone. Your belongings will be placed in a locker while you take the exam. If you’re allowed to have any scratch paper and a pen, those will be provided to you at exam time. Proctors will advise you of exam rules and conduct during the exam. Once you’re finished with the exam, instructions will appear on the screen to tell you what to do next, typically returning to the main desk to receive your exam results. Most exams are scored when you finish them, so you’ll know whether you passed before leaving the exam facility. The proctor may provide you with your exam results. The proctor will also return your belongings to you from your locker.</p>
<p>If you fail an exam and want to retake it, resume your studies as soon as possible while the exam questions and subject matter are fresh in your mind. Your exam results will often highlight your strongest and weakest topics so that you can focus on those before you retake the exam. Do retake the exam until you pass. Once you’re certified, no one will care how many times you have to take the exam. Use your new certified designation in your email signature, LinkedIn profile, professional correspondence, and online profiles. The next section covers independent study to enhance your technical skills.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Educating Yourself" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="educating_yourself">
<h1>Educating Yourself</h1>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with earning a certification.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="educating yourself" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872110208"/> No one will ever view it as a negative career move, although it might not impact your current or future job success. If certifications aren’t your thing, try some independent study. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="independent study" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657872752432"/>At one time, in IT shops, training was almost nonexistent. Companies didn’t want to pay for professional development training; the alternative is to educate yourself at your own expense and time.</p>
<p>I have spent thousands of dollars and many, many hours educating myself. I purchased and set up multiple systems in my garage, onto which I installed various operating systems and experimented. I installed operating systems, applications, and automation software. At one time, I had a Hyper-V infrastructure, a vSphere infrastructure, dozens of virtual machines comprising multiple Linux distributions, multiple Microsoft desktop and server systems, and even a few one-offs such as FreeBSD, FreeDOS, and a few others that I can’t recall. I would solve hardware, <span class="keep-together">software,</span> networking, printing, and application problems independently. Expanding my knowledge beyond my day job has kept me gainfully employed in full-time corporate jobs and a healthy freelance career for over 20 years. Part of my independent-study result is what you’re currently reading in this book.</p>
<p>Independent study can make you stand out in a crowd. For example, a very old Solaris system in one of our computer labs had experienced a failure. Due to layoffs and attrition, no one knew how to fix the system because the version of Solaris was so old. Unfortunately, the system owners also didn’t know how to fix it, but it had to be fixed because real dependencies were built around it. A company-wide email was issued to find someone who knew how to fix this computer dinosaur. I saw the email but ignored it until one of my colleagues, who knew of my independent study and history of solving weird problems, spoke up and volunteered me for the task. I successfully got the system working again that afternoon. The customer was grateful, and I received a few accolades and a gift card for a nice dinner for my efforts.</p>
<p>Independent study doesn’t require a big investment in hardware and software. You can sign up for free or inexpensive virtual infrastructure and explore cloud solutions, N-tier database setups, peer-to-peer networking, software development, and other technologies and solutions that would cost thousands of dollars to build on your own. Through independent discovery and exploration, you can develop skills with technologies you ordinarily wouldn’t have access to. I encourage you to search online to find independent-study opportunities.</p>
<p>The next section explores a newer aspect of training in traditional colleges and universities.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Formalizing Your Education" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="formalizing_your_education">
<h1>Formalizing Your Education</h1>
<p>During my more than 25 years in the IT industry, I’ve found that coworkers who don’t have degrees are about as common as those who do. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="formalizing your education" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657873291072"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="colleges and universities, IT education" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871723680"/>I’ve had managers who never went to a day of college. I’ve also worked with some people who earned master’s and PhD degrees in fields other than IT. Many of them, like myself, came to IT from other industries as career changers. There are multiple reasons for IT ranks being filled with people with degrees as diverse as psychology, English, and physics. Traditional colleges and universities didn’t support IT training until somewhat recently. Sure, a few colleges and universities offered management information systems (MIS) and computer information systems (CIS) degrees before that time. Still, these programs were light on content and not well-respected in the industry in the early days. These days, full degree programs cover game development, data science, networking, security, and cloud technologies.</p>
<p>One of the best approaches to advanced IT training is that some colleges and universities offer remote, online, and self-paced study, which is optimal for working professionals who want to further their education and skills without the traditional residence requirements. But not all degree programs are created equal. Some programs are not well-received in the industry, and you should research before spending thousands of dollars on a degree that many employers will dismiss as inadequate.</p>
<p>For example, security is a hot topic<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="security" data-secondary="colleges offering education in" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871642976"/> right now, and many colleges offer security training and degree programs, some of which also have a certification component. Do your research to find out which of them your employer supports. If your employer has a tuition reimbursement program, ask the coordinator if the college you’re exploring is on the approved list. If it isn’t, keep looking until you find one <span class="keep-together">that is.</span></p>
<p>The next section covers on-the-job training, which means gaining experience and education by doing a job.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Using Your Job as Education" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="using_your_job_as_education">
<h1>Using Your Job as Education</h1>
<p>Checking job descriptions might lead you to believe that some magical equation translates years on the job to years of education, and you’d be right. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job as education (on-the-job training)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871612400"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="using your job as education" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871617392"/>The magical ratio is one year of education equals two years of experience. This isn’t my opinion but an accepted industry standard. A <a href="https://oreil.ly/SSE3k">document</a> provided by Coordinated Care Services, Inc. (CCSI) states it explicitly for a range of education and experience. Education is important, but job experience is the real winner for landing most industry jobs.</p>
<p>Multiple online sources discuss the struggle between education and experience. Search for yourself using “experience vs. education” and you’ll see. The debate has raged for years. When you have no experience, the requirement for experience is a high barrier to employment.</p>
<p>To solve the education versus experience dilemma is to gain on-the-job experience to complement your education. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="experience versus education dilemma, solving" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871613232"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-secondary="using your job as education" data-tertiary="solving education versus experience dilemma" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871612592"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="job as education (on-the-job training)" data-secondary="education versus experience dilemma" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871610032"/>But how do you gain experience when you have none? You should explore volunteer opportunities, internships, and student apprenticeships, as well as documenting your work and research.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="student apprenticeships" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871616656"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="internships" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871699680"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="volunteer opportunities" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871599328"/></p>
<p>Volunteer opportunities don’t always present themselves—you must look for them. You could offer desktop and network support at churches, local theaters, volunteer organizations, schools, and even commercial businesses such as law firms, restaurants, and retail stores. Explain that you want to gain job experience and would like to volunteer your time for desktop support, network support, security, document management, website creation and maintenance, and other computer-related tasks. Many businesses either can’t afford to hire IT support or don’t need someone full-time and will welcome the opportunity to partner with you.</p>
<p>Internships and student apprenticeships are excellent ways to gain real job experience. These jobs, often subsidized by the government, colleges, or businesses, offer you employment that often is part of a degree, work-study, or scholarship program. Some internships and apprenticeships are competitive rather than based on need alone. Check with your school counselor, local employment office, or online sources to find out about such programs in your area.</p>
<p>You should also document your research and work. <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="documenting your work and research" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871748304"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="work and research, documenting" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871693776"/>For example, if you build computers, install and administer Linux systems, build specialized hardware, or code your own applications, you can document this work and add it to your résumé. Your work has career relevance and value to a potential employer, so write it down.</p>
<p>Once employed, try to learn everything you can about the business. Learn its business cycles, profitable areas, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, position in the marketplace, and current outlook.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Summary" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="summary-id00015">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Education and training are both important to your career arc. You must maintain your technical edge by keeping up with the latest versions, updates, security issues, and improvements in your industry. You must keep your certifications up to date with continuing education units and take the latest exams. Remember to document all software and hardware vendors, versions, and special features with which you work in your job because these items are important résumé builders.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that your value increases with everything you learn, whether from a class or on the job. Learn all you can from every possible source, and demonstrate your ability to put your learning into practice at the command line or in the data center.<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="education, continuing" data-startref="ix_edu" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45657871671456"/></p>
<p>The next and final chapter of this book covers making career moves. In it, I discuss starting your own business, moving into management, and a lot of general information on moving your career forward and avoiding pitfalls along the way.</p>
