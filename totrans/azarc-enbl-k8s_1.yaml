- en: In today’s world of tech, many organizations large and small have embraced cloud.
    Organizations often opt for a hybrid and multicloud strategy, and they often have
    some workloads running on-premises while other workloads run across multiple cloud
    providers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Organizations adopt a hybrid and multicloud strategy for a number of reasons:
    it helps them realize the benefits of their on-premises investments, avoid vendor
    lock-in, and minimize downtime risk from a single cloud provider, and it gives
    them the ability to leverage the innovation of technologies from any cloud provider
    they choose.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With this choice comes new deployment and management challenges. One of the
    first challenges is handling differences between each cloud provider and the differences
    in the native tooling used for governance and management of each. This can be
    expensive to run and hard to keep up with.

- en: Another challenge is skill sets—getting your IT teams skilled up on a single
    cloud is challenging enough, but mastering two or three different cloud platforms
    is even more difficult. Being able to train on a single toolset or cloud lowers
    the barrier to your teams managing multicloud. Solutions are available for solving
    this challenge, and Azure Arc is one such solution.

    and multicloud management need. Microsoft announced Azure Arc during their 2019
    annual Ignite conference, which created excitement and buzz because it was a game-changer
    in the world of cloud.

    multicloud. Azure Arc sets out to simplify complex and distributed environments
    by bringing the Azure plane and its management tools to on-premises, edge, and
    multicloud. Azure Arc gives IT teams the ability to deploy workloads and manage
    resources, regardless of where they exist.

    you can deploy containerized workloads to a Kubernetes cluster running in Azure
    or outside of Azure, or you can deploy a SQL or PostgreSQL database to a non-Azure-based
    environment. With Azure Arc, you’re essentially projecting resources from your
    other environments into ARM. Once a resource is projected into Azure Arc, you
    can then start using Azure native tooling to govern, manage, and deploy to it.

    servers. Azure VM uses many of the native Azure Management services, such as inventory,
    change tracking, update management, Azure Policy, and the Azure Arc control plane
    functionality. Note that there is a charge for each additional Azure Management
    service, such as Azure Monitor, Azure Policy Guest Configuration, Security Center,
    Azure Defender, Azure Sentinel, and Azure Automation. You can check the Azure
    Arc [pricing page](https://oreil.ly/HZOrV) for the latest pricing updates.

    2020 State Of The Cloud Report](https://oreil.ly/K-t9W), 93% of enterprises have
    a multicloud strategy. multicloud drives up the need for a single pane of glass
    even further because more multicloud architectures are more complex and challenging
    to manage. It’s essential to have tooling that enables strong governance and security
    of resources and workloads between multiple clouds. Microsoft has answered the
    call, and compared to their competitors and Azure Arc’s counterparts in the market,
    it stands out for its distinctive design and approach, as it allows you to leave
    your workloads where you want and extend Azure tooling to those workloads.

    Anthos, a managed application platform extending GCP services to any environment.
    With Anthos, the approach is move workloads to containers running on Google Kubernetes
    Engine (GKE). In contrast, the approach of Azure Arc is to provide flexibility
    and allow users to choose to leave resources on-premises, in other clouds, or
    to run them in Azure. In contrast with Anthos, Azure Arc allows customers to run
    on virtual machines or containers; Arc extends the control plane to both and serves
    as the overarching management layer for these resources. Arc can be used to assist
    with the lifecycle of resources spanning virtual machines, database instances,
    and Kubernetes clusters, whereas its counterparts focus solely on containers.

    clusters that are projected into Azure Arc regardless of where they live, giving
