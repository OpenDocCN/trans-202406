- en: Spend some time at a KubeCon + CloudNativeCon conference these days and you
    will quickly conclude that the future of Kubernetes is very bright. Attendance
    at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon conferences is experiencing an explosive level of
    growth. In addition, the Kubernetes open source community of contributors continues
    to expand and strengthen. The number of industries that are adopting Kubernetes
    is astounding.^([1](ch09.html#ch01fn40)) Similarly, OpenShift has seen its customer
    base grow from 1,000 to 1,700 in the past year and has also seen strong adoption
    among Fortune 2000 companies.^([2](ch09.html#ch01fn41)) In this chapter, we make
    some predictions about what the future holds for both traditional Kubernetes and
    OpenShift. We discuss our expectations for how these technologies will grow and
    increase their impact across numerous facets of cloud native computing, including
    legacy application migration, high performance computing, machine learning and
    deep learning applications, open source marketplaces, and multicloud environments.
    We then conclude this chapter with a discussion of recommended resources for further
    study.

- en: Over the years, both traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift have made dramatic
    improvements that will result in accelerating the migration of legacy enterprise
    applications to cloud native applications. With the introduction of the operator
    framework, these platforms are now much more capable of supporting stateful applications,
    as well as managing the complete software management life cycle for these applications.
    Additionally, as mentioned earlier in this book, the OpenShift platform continues
    to innovate in areas of tooling that reduce the complexity of moving from source
    code to having a fully functional containerized cloud native application. At the
    same time, Kubernetes and OpenShift are greatly increasing the types of applications
    they can support by leveraging new projects like Knative to support serverless
    and function-based programming models. The convergence of all these innovations
    makes traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift in particular well-suited to support
    an even greater domain of enterprise applications. Thus, we anticipate that in
    the near future there will be a dramatic acceleration in the migration of legacy
    enterprise applications to cloud native applications that run on traditional Kubernetes
    and OpenShift. Furthermore, we anticipate even greater interoperability and integration
    will occur between traditional mainframe applications and cloud native applications.
    In fact, there is already some early experimental work demonstrating that COBOL
    applications can be containerized and run on both Kubernetes and OpenShift.^([3](ch09.html#ch01fn43))

- en: There is a long, rich history of using server clusters for supporting high performance
    computing initiatives. Pioneering work in this space began in the late 1980s with
    platforms like the Parallel Virtual Machine.^([4](ch09.html#ch01fn44)) Over the
    years, the high performance computing community has embraced new technologies
    that improve efficiency and scalability. Kubernetes and its container-based approach
    provide several benefits that make the environment well-suited for high performance
    computing applications. Because Kubernetes is container based, the platform experiences
    less overhead to start up new tasks, and the tasks can be of a finer grain operation
    than those supported by VM-based cloud computing environments. The reduction of
    latency associated with the creation and destruction of computational tasks that
    occur when using containers instead of VMs improves the scalability of a high
    performance computing environment. Furthermore, the increased efficiency that
    is possible by packing a larger number of containers onto a physical server in
    contrast to the limited number of VMs that can be placed on a physical server
    is another critical advantage for high performance applications.

    queue model. An excellent overview of the Kubernetes work queue model can be found
    in [*Kubernetes Up and Running*](https://oreil.ly/e6rve) (O’Reilly). The work
    queue model described in this book is essentially the “bag of tasks” parallel
    computing model. Research has shown that this parallel computing model is a superior
    approach for the execution of high performance parallel applications in a cluster
    environment.^([5](ch09.html#ch01fn45))

    it continues to innovate in ways that improve its ability to efficiently run workloads.
    Most recently, Kubernetes made significant advances to its workload-scheduling
    algorithms that enable it to achieve better cluster utilization and high availability
    for its workloads.^([6](ch09.html#ch01fn46)) The efforts the Kubernetes SIG Scheduler
    team has made over the years has culminated in Kubernetes being a platform that
    is incredibly flexible and efficient in how it schedules workloads for a variety
    of custom application needs.^([7](ch09.html#ch01fn47))

    environments. Data scientists with expertise in these domains want easy-to-use
    platforms that enable their applications to run in production at scale. Similar
    to our justification provided for adopting Kubernetes for high performance computing,
    we anticipate that machine learning and deep learning environments will greatly
    benefit from adopting Kubernetes-based environments as their primary platforms.
    In fact, initiatives like [Kubeflow](https://oreil.ly/NjZxV), which are focused
    on providing an open source Kubernetes-based platform for machine learning applications,
    are already attracting a significant number of contributors to their open source
    projects.

- en: An increasing number of enterprises are beginning to use both multiple public
    clouds and private datacenters hosting their on-premises clouds. These enterprises
    are quickly realizing that they need an easy way to purchase, deploy, and manage
    cloud native application software that runs across all these environments. To
    address this situation, open cloud marketplaces are emerging. In these marketplaces,
    cloud native applications are packaged up using the Kubernetes operator packaging
    model. This approach enables the open cloud marketplace to automatically install,
    deploy, update, scale, and back up cloud native applications.

    they have few opportunities to select an application stack and associated tooling.
    An open cloud marketplace like Red Hat Marketplace enables developers to try their
    desired software for free and progress seamlessly to a commercially supported
    version when they are ready. In addition, Red Hat Marketplace can provide visibility
    to development managers into how much consumption of deploying applications to
    each cloud is occurring. This lets them see how utilization is occurring across
    each platform and enables them to better manage development costs.

- en: After reading this book, this last prediction should come as no surprise to
    you. OpenShift has proven that it provides superior interoperability and workload
    portability and is available from all major cloud providers, including IBM Cloud,
    Google Cloud, Amazon Cloud, Azure, and many others. In addition, OpenShift leverages
    the Istio Service Mesh, and this critical networking technology reduces the complexity
    of connecting applications that reside in different clouds. It also has built-in
    tools specifically tailored for managing multicloud clusters. For all these reasons
    we fully expect OpenShift to be the preferred platform for enterprise multicloud
    activities. In fact, many enterprise customers that use OpenShift have already
    embraced the use of multiple clusters, and these clusters are deployed across
    multiple clouds or in multiple datacenters. This behavior can result from several
    factors. First, an enterprise might inherit applications that run on a different
    cloud due to an acquisition. Second, different clouds may offer different services,
    and the enterprise may require a best-of-breed solution that encompasses the use
    of a multicloud solution. Third, data locality constraints can serve as an anchor
    for critical applications on certain clouds or perhaps on a premises cloud. For
    all these reasons, OpenShift is well positioned to be the ideal platform for enterprise
    multicloud applications.

    run both Kubernetes and OpenShift in production. We provided a historical overview
    of traditional Kubernetes and OpenShift and discussed the key benefits of both
    platforms that have driven the huge growth in their popularity. We described the
    architecture for both environments and important Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts.
    We then began a journey into foundational production-related topics, such as advanced
    resource management, single cluster high availability, and continuous delivery.
    Next, we explored the more advanced topic of multicluster utilization with a focus
    on multicluster provisioning, upgrading, and policy support. We then looked at
    a working example of multicluster application delivery. Finally, we ended with
    a short discussion on what the future holds for Kubernetes and OpenShift, and
    we presented several recommended resources for further study. We hope you have
    found this book helpful and that it has given you the in-depth skills and confidence
    to develop and deploy cloud native applications on the most sophisticated and
    advanced Kubernetes and OpenShift production-level environments you could possibly
    encounter.
