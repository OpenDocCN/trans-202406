- en: A warm welcome to *Learning Modern Linux*! I’m glad that we will walk this journey
    together for a bit. This book is for you if you’ve already been using Linux and
    are looking for a structured, hands-on approach to dive in deeper, or if you already
    have experience and want to get some tips and tricks to improve your flow when
    working with Linux—for example, in a professional setup, such as development or
    operations.

- en: We’ll focus on using Linux for your everyday needs, from development to office-related
    tasks, rather than on the system administration side of things. Also, we’ll focus
    on the command line, not visual UIs. So, while 2022 might be the year of Linux
    on the desktop after all, we’ll use the terminal as the main way to interact with
    Linux. This has the additional advantage that you can equally apply your knowledge
    in many different setups, from a Raspberry Pi to the virtual machine of your cloud
    provider of choice.

- en: 'Before we start, I’d like to provide some context by sharing my own journey:
    my first hands-on experience with an operating system was not with Linux. The
    first operating system I used was AmigaOS (in the late 80s), and after that, in
    technical high school, I mainly used Microsoft DOS and the then-new Microsoft
    Windows, specifically around the event system and user interface–related development.
    Then, in the mid- to late 1990s, during my studies at university, I mainly used
    Unix-based Solaris and Silicon Graphics machines in the university labs. I really
    only got into Linux in the mid-2000s in the context of big data and then when
    I started working with containers, first in 2015 in the context of Apache Mesos
    (working at Mesosphere), and then with Kubernetes (initially at Red Hat on the
    OpenShift team and then at AWS on the container service team). That’s where I
    realized that one needs to master Linux to be effective in this space. Linux is
    different. Its background, worldwide community of users, and versatility and flexibility
    make it unique.'

- en: Linux is an interesting, ever-growing ecosystem of open source individuals and
    vendors. It runs on pretty much anything under the sun, from the $50 Raspberry
    Pi to the virtual machines of your favorite cloud provider to a Mars vehicle.
    After 30 years in the making, Linux will likely stick around for some time, so
    now is a good time to get into Linux a bit deeper.

    how you can get the most out of this book as well as some administrative things,
    like where and how you can try out the topics we’ll work through together.

- en: This book is for those who want or need to use Linux in a professional setup,
    such as software developers, software architects, QA testing engineers, DevOps
    and SRE roles, and similar roles. I’ll assume that if you’re a hobbyist encountering
    Linux when pursuing an activity such as 3D printing or home improvement, you have
    very little to no knowledge about operating systems in general or Linux/UNIX in
    particular. You will get the most out of the book if you work through it from
    beginning to end, as the chapters tend to build on one another; however, you can
    also use it as a reference if you’re already familiar with Linux.

- en: By the end of this book, you will understand what Linux is ([Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#intro-to-linux))
    and what its critical components are (Chapters [2](ch02.xhtml#kernel) and [3](ch03.xhtml#shells-scripting)).
    You’ll be able to enumerate and use essential access control mechanisms ([Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#access-control)).
    You’ll also understand the role of filesystems ([Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#files))
    as a fundamental building block in Linux as well as know what apps ([Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#running-apps))
    are.

    tooling ([Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#networking)). Further, you’ll learn about modern
    operating system observability ([Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#observability)) and how
    to apply it to manage your workloads.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll understand how to run Linux applications in modern ways by using containers
    as well as immutable distros such as Bottlerocket and also how to securely communicate
    (download files, etc.) and share data using Secure Shell (SSH) and advanced tooling
    like peer-to-peer and cloud sync mechanisms ([Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#advanced)).

    StarBook from [Star Labs](https://oreil.ly/1MbY2). Alternatively, you could use
    a desktop or laptop that no longer runs a recent Windows version and install Linux
    on it.

    by providing nonsensical or deliberately strange inputs. Before you execute the
    command, form a hypothesis about the outcome.'

    try to figure out where it came from and what the underlying component responsible
