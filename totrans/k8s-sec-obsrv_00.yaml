- en: Kubernetes is not secure by default. Existing approaches to enterprise and cloud
    security are challenged by the dynamic nature of Kubernetes and the goal of increased
    organizational agility that often comes with using it. Successfully securing,
    observing, and troubleshooting mission-critical microservices in this new environment
    requires a holistic understanding of a breadth of considerations. These include
    organizational challenges, how new cloud native approaches can help meet the challenges,
    and the new best practices and how to operationalize them.

    and formulating a comprehensive security and observability strategy can be a daunting
    task and in many cases leads to gaps that significantly undermine the desired
    security posture.

    strategy across the breadth of these considerations and to give you best practices
    and tools to help you as you move applications to Kubernetes.

- en: Over our years of working at Tigera and building Calico, a networking and security
    tool for Kubernetes, we have gotten to see the user journey up close. We have
    seen many users focus on getting their workloads deployed in Kubernetes without
    thinking through their security or observability strategy, and then struggle as
    they try to understand how to secure and observe such a complex distributed system.
    Our goal with this book is to help minimize this pain as much as possible by sharing
    with you what we’ve learned. We mention a number of tool examples throughout,
    and Calico is among them. We believe that Calico is an excellent and popular option,
    but there are many good tools, like Weave Net, VMware Tanzu, Aqua Security, and
    Datadog, to choose from. Ultimately, only you can decide which is best for your
    needs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    environment, and starting to think about how you can use Kubernetes in your environment.
    In this stage you want to leverage the online Kubernetes resources available and
    use open source technologies.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you familiarize yourself with Kubernetes and understand how it works, you
    start thinking about a high-level strategy to adopt Kubernetes. In this stage
    you typically do a pilot project to set up your cluster and onboard a couple of
    applications. As you progress in this stage, you will have an idea about which
    platforms you’re going to use and whether they will be on-premise or in the cloud.
    If you choose cloud, you will decide whether to host the cluster yourself or leverage
    a managed Kubernetes service from a cloud provider. You also need to think about
    strategies to secure your applications. By this time, you would have realized
    that Kubernetes is different due to its declarative nature. This means that the
    platform abstracts a lot of details about the network, infrastructure, host, etc.,
    and therefore makes it very easy for you to use the platform for your applications.
    Because of this, the current methods you use to secure your applications, infrastructure,
    and networks simply do not work, so you now need to think about security that
    is native to Kubernetes.

    a few applications. Your focus is on running mission-critical applications in
    production and on considering whether to migrate most of your applications to
    Kubernetes. In this stage you need to have detailed plans for security, compliance,
    troubleshooting, and observability in order to safely and efficiently move your
    applications to production and realize all the benefits of the Kubernetes platform.

- en: The popularity and success of Kubernetes as a platform for container-based applications
    has many people eager to adopt it. In the past couple of years, there has been
    an effort by managed Kubernetes service providers to innovate and make adoption
    easier. New users may be tempted to go past the learning and pilot stages in order
    to get to the production stage quickly. We caution against skipping due diligence.
    You must consider security and observability as critical first steps before you
    onboard mission-critical applications to Kubernetes; your Kubernetes adoption
    is incomplete and potentially insecure without them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for a broad range of Kubernetes practitioners who are in the pilot/pre-production
    stage of adoption. You may be a platform engineer or part of the security or DevOps
    team. Some of you are the first in your organization to adopt Kubernetes and want
    to do security and observability right from the start. Others are helping to establish
    best practices within an organization that has already adopted Kubernetes but
    has not yet solved the security and observability challenges Kubernetes presents.
    We assume you have basic knowledge of Kubernetes—what it is and how to use it
    as an orchestration tool for hosting applications. We also assume you understand
    how applications are deployed and their distributed nature in a Kubernetes cluster.

    will find value in this book. Please note that the role names may be different
    in your organization, so please look at the responsibilities for each to identify
    the corresponding role in your organization. We will use these names throughout
    the book to help you understand how a concept impacts each role.

    of the Kubernetes platform. Many enterprises choose to implement a container as
    a service platform (CaaS) strategy. This is a platform that is used across the
    enterprise to implement container-based workloads. The platform engineering team
    is responsible for the platform components and provides them as a service to application
    teams. This book helps you understand the importance of securing the platform
    and best practices to help secure the platform layer—that way you can provide
    application teams a way to onboard applications on a secure Kubernetes platform.
    It will also help you learn how to manage the security risk of new applications
    to the platform.

    of Kubernetes and in a cloud environment where Kubernetes clusters are self-hosted
    or leverage a managed Kubernetes service. You will understand the importance of
    network security and how to build networks with a strong security posture. Best
    practices for exposing applications outside the Kubernetes platform as well as
    network access for applications to external networks are examples of topics covered
    in this book. You will also learn how to collaborate with other teams to implement
    network security to protect elements external to Kubernetes from workloads inside
    Kubernetes.

    environments and are different from traditional applications. As an example, these
    applications are distributed across the infrastructure in your network. This book
    will help you understand details about how to secure a Kubernetes platform that
    is used to host applications. It will provide you a complete view of how to secure
    mission-critical workloads. You will learn how to collaborate with various teams
    to effectively implement security in the new and different world of Kubernetes.

    requirements and how to monitor ongoing compliance in a Kubernetes-based platform.

    reliability engineers (SREs). They ensure that applications are onboarded and
    meet the required service level agreements (SLAs). In this book you will learn
    about your role in securing the Kubernetes cluster and collaboration with the
    security team. We will cover the concept of shift-left security, which says security
    needs to happen very early in the application development life cycle. Observability
    in a Kubernetes platform means the ability to infer details about the operation
    of your cluster by viewing data from the platform. This is the modern way of monitoring
    a distributed application, and you will learn how to implement observability and
    what its importance to security is.

    without the help, support and guidance of several people. Firstly, we want to
    thank the community, developers and maintainers of Project Calico, your innovation
    and contributions to Kubernetes and Kubernetes security and observability, have
    enabled us to write this book. The amazing engineering and the security research
    teams at Tigera have built products to address the complex challenges for security
    and observability, and this enabled us to get a clear understanding of the challenges
    facing the users. This was very helpful as we wrote this book to guide users to
    a holistic security and observability solution.

    matter expertise. Their comments and guidance have greatly enriched the content
    of this book. Special mention to Manish Sampat, Alex Pollitt, Virginia Wilson,
    Seth Vargo, Tim Mackey, Ian Lewis, Puja Absassi, and Jose Ruiz—you are awesome!
