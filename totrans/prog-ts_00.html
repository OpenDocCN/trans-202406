<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>This is a book for programmers of all walks: professional JavaScript engineers, C# people, Java sympathizers, Python lovers, Ruby aficionados, Haskell nerds. Whatever language(s) you write in, so long as you have some experience programming and know the basics of functions, variables, classes, and errors, this book is for you. Some experience with JavaScript, including a basic knowledge of the Document Object Model (DOM) and the network, will help you along the way—while we don’t dive deep into these concepts, they are a wellspring of excellent examples, and if you’re not familiar with them the examples might not make as much sense.<a data-primary="JavaScript" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46304996396648"/><a data-primary="DOM (Document Object Model)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46304996395784"/></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Regardless of what programming languages you’ve used in the past, what unites all of us is our shared experience of tracking down exceptions, tracing through code line by line to figure out what went wrong and how we can fix it. This is the experience that TypeScript helps prevent by examining your code automatically and pointing out the mistakes you may have missed.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s OK if you haven’t worked with a statically typed language before. I’ll teach you about types and how to use them effectively to make your programs crash less, document your code better, and scale your applications across more users, engineers, and servers. I’ll try to avoid big words when I can, and explain ideas in a way that’s intuitive, memorable, and practical, using lots of examples along the way to help keep things concrete.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>That’s the thing about TypeScript: unlike a lot of other typed languages, TypeScript is intensely practical. It invents completely new concepts so you can speak more concisely and precisely, letting you write applications in a way that’s fun, modern, and safe.</p>&#13;

<h1>How This Book Is Organized</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book has two aims: to give you a deep understanding of how the TypeScript language works (theory) and provide bucketfuls of pragmatic advice about how to write production TypeScript code (practice).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Because TypeScript is such a practical language,  theory quickly turns to practice, and most of this book ends up being a mix of the two, with the first couple of chapters almost entirely theory, and the last few almost completely practice.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I’ll start with the basics of what compilers, typecheckers, and types are. I’ll then give a broad overview of the different types and type operators in TypeScript, what they’re for, and how you use them. Using what we’ve learned, I’ll cover some advanced topics like TypeScript’s most sophisticated type system features, error handling, and asynchronous programming. Finally, I’ll wrap up with how to use TypeScript with your favorite frameworks (frontend and backend), migrating your existing JavaScript project to TypeScript, and running your TypeScript application in production.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Most chapters come with a set of exercises at the end. Try to do these yourself—they’ll give you a deeper intuition for what we cover than just reading would. Answers for chapter exercises are available online, at <a href="https://github.com/bcherny/programming-typescript-answers"><em class="hyperlink">https://github.com/bcherny/programming-typescript-answers</em></a>.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Style" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46304996474376">&#13;
<h1>Style</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Throughout this book, I tried to stick to a single code style.<a data-primary="code style" data-secondary="in this book" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46304996504680"/> Some aspects of this style are deeply personal—for example:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>I only use semicolons when necessary.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>I indent with two spaces.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>I use short variable names like <code>a</code>, <code>f</code>, or _ where the program is a quick snippet, or where the structure of the program is more important than the details.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Some aspects of the code style, however, are things that I think you should do too. A few of these are:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You should use the latest JavaScript syntax and features (the latest JavaScript version is usually just called “esnext”).<a data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="latest syntax and features" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46304996472328"/> This will keep your code in line with the latest standards, improving interoperability and Googleability, and it can help reduce ramp-up time for new hires. It also lets you take advantage of powerful, modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, promises, and generators.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You should keep your data structures immutable with spreads (<code>...</code>) most of the time.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="preface01.html#idm46304996469720" id="idm46304996469720-marker">1</a></sup></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You should make sure everything has a type, inferred when possible. Be careful not to abuse explicit types; this will help keep your code clear and terse, and improve safety by surfacing incorrect types rather than bandaiding over them.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You should keep your code reusable and generic. Polymorphism (see <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#polymorphism">“Polymorphism”</a>) is your best friend.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Of course, these ideas are hardly new. But TypeScript works especially well when you stick to them. TypeScript’s built-in downlevel compiler, support for read-only types, powerful type inference, deep support for polymorphism, and completely structural type system encourage good coding style, while the language remains incredibly expressive and true to the underlying JavaScript.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A couple more notes before we begin.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>JavaScript doesn’t expose pointers and references; instead it has value and reference types.<a data-primary="values" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46304996181688"/><a data-primary="reference types" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46304996180984"/> Values are immutable, and include things like strings, numbers, and booleans, while references point to often-mutable data structures like arrays, objects, and functions. When I use the word “value” in this book, I usually mean it loosely to refer to either a JavaScript value or a reference.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lastly, you might find yourself writing less-than-ideal TypeScript code in the wild when interoperating with JavaScript, or incorrectly typed third-party libraries, or legacy code, or if you’re in a rush. This book largely presents how you <em>should</em> write TypeScript, and makes an argument for why you should try really hard not to make compromises. But in practice, how correct your code is is up to you and your team.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is the product of years’ worth of snippets and doodles, followed by a year’s worth of early mornings and nights and weekends and holidays spent writing.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you to O’Rielly for the opportunity to work on this book, and to my editor Angela Rufino for the support throughout the process. Thank you to Nick Nance for his contribution in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#APIs">“Typesafe APIs”</a>, and to Shyam Seshadri for his contribution in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#Angular">“Angular 6/7”</a>. Thanks to my technical editors: Daniel Rosenwasser of the TypeScript team, who spent an unreasonable amount of time reading through this manuscript and guiding me through the nuances of TypeScript’s type system, and Jonathan Creamer, Yakov Fain, and Paul Buying, and Rachel Head for technical edits and feedback. Thanks to my family—Liza and Ilya, Vadim, Roza and Alik, Faina and Yosif—for encouraging me to pursue this project.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Most of all, thanks to my partner Sara Gilford, who supported me throughout the writing process, even when it meant calling off weekend plans, late nights writing and coding, and far too many unprompted conversations about the ins and outs of type systems. I couldn’t have done it without you, and I’m forever grateful for your <span class="keep-together">support</span>.</p>&#13;
