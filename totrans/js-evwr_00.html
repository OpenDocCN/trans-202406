<h1>Foreword</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>In 1997 I was a junior in high school. A friend and I were goofing&#13;
around with the web-connected computer in our school library when he&#13;
showed me that you could click View → Source to see the underlying&#13;
code of a web page. A few days later, another friend showed me how to&#13;
publish my own HTML. My mind was blown.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After that, I was hooked. I went around borrowing the bits of the&#13;
websites I liked to construct my own Franken-site. I spent much of my&#13;
free time at the pieced-together computer in my family’s dining room&#13;
tinkering away. I even “wrote” (OK, copied and pasted) my first&#13;
JavaScript, to implement hover styles on links, which was not yet doable&#13;
with simple CSS.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And in a turn of events that I’ve come to think of as a nerdy and&#13;
wholesome version of the film <em>Almost Famous</em>, my homegrown music site&#13;
gained reasonable popularity. Because of this, I received promotional&#13;
CDs in the mail and was put on the guest list at concerts. More&#13;
important to me, however, was that I was sharing my interests with other&#13;
people around the world. I was a bored suburban teenager, in love with&#13;
music, and was able to reach people I’d never meet. That was, and still&#13;
is, such an empowering feeling.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Today, we can build powerful applications using only web technologies,&#13;
but it can be daunting to get started. APIs are an invisible background&#13;
that serves up data. View → Source shows concatenated and minified&#13;
code. Authentication and security are mystifying. Putting all of these&#13;
things together can be overwhelming. If we’re able to look beyond these&#13;
confusing details, we may notice that the same technologies I was&#13;
fiddling with 20-some years ago can now be used to build powerful web&#13;
applications, code native mobile applications, create powerful desktop&#13;
applications, design 3D animations, and even program robots.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">As an educator, I’ve found that many of us learn best by building new&#13;
things, taking them apart, and adapting them for our own use cases.&#13;
That is the goal of this book. If you know some HTML, CSS, and&#13;
JavaScript but are unsure of how to take those components and build the&#13;
robust applications that you’ve dreamed up, this book is for you. I’ll&#13;
guide you through building an API that can power the user interfaces of&#13;
a web application, a native mobile application, and a desktop&#13;
application. Most importantly, you’ll gain an understanding of how all&#13;
of these pieces fit together so that you can build and create wonderful&#13;
things.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I can’t wait to see what you make.</p>&#13;
