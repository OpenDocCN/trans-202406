And we have covered a remarkable amount of ground, but we’ve still only scratched the surface of the packages, techniques, and frameworks that are available to you.  In this chapter, we’ll discuss where you can go for additional resources.</p>

<h1>Online Documentation</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CSS" data-secondary="online documentation" id="idm45053571643528"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript" data-secondary="online documentation" id="idm45053571642552"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="learning resources" data-secondary="online documentation" id="idm45053571641608"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)" id="idm45053571640664"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)" id="idm45053571640024"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="online documentation" id="idm45053571639384"/>For JavaScript, CSS, and HTML documentation, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a> is without equal.  If I need JavaScript documentation, I either search directly on MDN or append “mdn” to my search query.  Otherwise, inevitably, w3schools appears in the search.  Whoever is managing SEO for w3schools is a genius, but I recommend avoiding this site: I find the documentation is often severely lacking.</p>

Finally, the official specifications for HTML and CSS are located on the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C website</a>; they are dry, difficult-to-read documents, but sometimes it’s your only recourse for the very hardest problems.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ECMA-262 ECMAScript language specification" id="idm45053571631128"/>JavaScript adheres to the <a href="http://bit.ly/ECMA-262_specs">ECMA-262 ECMAScript language specification</a>.  To track the availability of JavaScript features in Node (and various browsers), see the excellent <a href="http://bit.ly/36SoK53">guide maintained by @kangax</a>.</p>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Node" data-secondary="online documentation" id="idm45053571628472"/>The <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs">Node documentation</a> is very good, and comprehensive, and it should be your first choice for authoritative documentation about Node modules (such as <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, and <code>fs</code>).  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Express" data-secondary="online documentation" id="idm45053571625064"/>The <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express documentation</a> is quite good, but not as comprehensive as one might like.  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="npm (package manager)" data-secondary="online documentation" id="idm45053571623240"/>The <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">npm documentation</a> is comprehensive and useful.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Stack Overflow"><div class="sect1" id="idm45053571600424">
<h1>Stack Overflow</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="learning resources" data-secondary="Stack Overflow (SO)" id="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc2"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="SO (Stack Overflow)" id="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc3"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Stack Overflow (SO)" id="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc4"/>Chances are good that you’ve already used Stack Overflow (SO): since its inception in 2008, it has become the dominant online Q&amp;A site, and is your best resource to get your JavaScript, Node, and Express questions answered (and any other technology covered in this book).  Stack Overflow is a community-maintained, reputation-based Q&amp;A site.  The reputation model is what’s responsible for the quality of the site and its continued success.  Users can gain reputation by having their questions or answers “upvoted” or having an accepted answer.  You don’t have to have any reputation to ask a question, and registration is free.  However, there are things you can do to increase the chances of getting your question answered in a useful manner, which we’ll discuss in this section.</p>

<p>Reputation is the currency of Stack Overflow, and while there are people out there who genuinely want to help you, it’s the chance to gain reputation that’s the icing on the cake that motivates good answers.  There are a lot of really smart people on SO, and they’re all competing to provide the first and/or best correct answer to your question (there’s a strong disincentive to provide a quick but bad answer, thankfully).  Here are things you can do to increase the chances of getting a good answer for your question:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Be an informed SO user</dt>
<dd>
<p>Take the <a href="http://bit.ly/2rFhSbb">SO tour</a>, and then read <a href="http://bit.ly/2p7Qnpw">“How do I ask a good question?”</a>  If you’re so inclined, you can go on to read all of the <a href="http://bit.ly/36UnyOp">help documentation</a>—you’ll earn a badge if you read it all!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Don’t ask questions that have already been answered</dt>
<dd>
<p>Do your due diligence, and try to find out if someone has already asked your question.  If you ask a question that has an easily found answer already on SO, your question will quickly be closed as a duplicate, and people will often downvote you for this, negatively affecting your reputation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Don’t ask people to write your code for you</dt>
<dd>
<p>You will quickly find your question downvoted and closed if you simply ask, “How do I do <em>X</em>?” The SO community expects you to make an effort to solve your own problem before resorting to SO.  Describe in your question what you’ve tried and why it isn’t working.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Ask one question at a time</dt>
<dd>
<p>Questions that are asking five things—“How do I do this, then that, then the other things, and what’s the best way to do this?”—are difficult to answer and are <span class="keep-together">discouraged.</span></p>
</dd>
<dt>Craft a minimal example of your issue</dt>
<dd>
<p>I answer a lot of SO questions, and the ones I almost automatically skip over are those where I see three pages of code (or more!).  Just taking your 5,000-line file and pasting into an SO question is not a great way to get your question answered (but people do it all the time).  It’s a lazy approach that isn’t often rewarded.  Not only are you less likely to get a useful answer, but the very process of eliminating things that <em>aren’t</em> causing the problem can lead you to solving the problem yourself (then you don’t even need to ask a question on SO).  Crafting a minimal example is good for your debugging skills and for your critical thinking ability, and makes you a good SO citizen.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Learn Markdown</dt>
<dd>
<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Markdown" id="idm45053571580552"/>Stack Overflow uses Markdown for formatting questions and answers.  A well-formatted question has a better chance of being answered, so you should invest the time to learn this useful and increasingly ubiquitous <a href="http://bit.ly/2CB1L0a">markup language</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Accept and upvote answers</dt>
<dd>
<p>If someone answers your question satisfactorily, you should upvote and accept it; it boosts the reputation of the answerer, and reputation is what drives SO.  If multiple people provide acceptable answers, you should pick the one you think is best and accept that, and upvote anyone else you feel offered a useful answer.</p>
</dd>
<dt>If you figure out your own problem before someone else does, answer your own <span class="kekep-together">question</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>SO is a community resource: if you have a problem, chances are, someone else has it too.  If you’ve figured it out, go ahead and answer your own question for the benefit of others.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you enjoy helping the community, consider answering questions yourself: it’s fun and rewarding, and it can lead to benefits that are more tangible than an arbitrary reputation score.  If you have a question for which you’ve received no useful answers for two days, you can start a <em>bounty</em> on the question, using your own reputation.  The reputation is withdrawn from your account immediately, and it is nonrefundable.  If someone answers the question to your satisfaction, and you accept their answer, they will receive the bounty.  The catch is, of course, you have to have reputation to start a bounty: the minimum bounty is 50 reputation points.  While you can get reputation from asking quality questions, it’s usually quicker to get reputation by providing quality answers.</p>

<p>Answering people’s questions also has the benefit of being a great way to learn.  I generally feel that I learn more from answering other people’s questions than I do from having my questions answered.  If you want to really thoroughly learn a technology, learn the basics and then start trying to tackle people’s questions on SO. At first you might be consistently beat out by people who are already experts, but before long, you’ll find that you <em>are</em> one of the experts.</p>

<p>Lastly, you shouldn’t hesitate to use your reputation to further your career.  A good reputation is absolutely worth putting on a résumé.  It’s worked for me and, now that I’m in the position of interviewing developers myself, I’m always impressed to see a good SO reputation (I consider a “good” SO reputation anything over 3,000; five-digit reputations are <em>great</em>).  A good SO reputation tells me that someone is not just competent in their field, but they are clear communicators and generally helpful.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc4" id="idm45053571570776"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc3" id="idm45053571570056"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc2" id="idm45053571569368"/></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Contributing to Express"><div class="sect1" id="idm45053571568552">
<h1>Contributing to Express</h1>

<p><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Express" data-secondary="contributing to" id="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc5"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Express" data-secondary="submitting pull requests" id="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc6"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="learning resources" data-secondary="contributing to Express" id="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc7"/>Express and Connect are open source projects, so anyone can submit <em>pull requests</em> (GitHub lingo for changes you’ve made that you would like included in the project).  This is not easy to do: the developers working on these projects are pros and the ultimate authority on their own projects.  I’m not discouraging you from contributing, but I am saying you have to dedicate some significant effort to be a successful contributor, and you cannot take submissions lightly.</p>

<p>The actual process of contributing is well-documented on the <a href="http://bit.ly/2q7WD0X">Express home page</a>.  The mechanics involve forking the project in your own GitHub account, cloning that fork, making your changes, pushing them back to GitHub, and creating a pull request (PR), which will be reviewed by one or more people on the project.  If your submissions are small or are bug fixes, you may have luck simply submitting the pull request.  If you’re trying to do something major, you should communicate with one of the main developers and discuss your contribution.  You don’t want to waste hours or days on a complicated feature only to find that it doesn’t fit with the maintainer’s vision, or it’s already being worked on by someone else.</p>

<p>The other way to contribute (indirectly) to the development of Express and Connect is to publish npm packages—specifically, middleware.  Publishing your own middleware requires approval from no one, but that doesn’t mean you should carelessly clutter the npm registry with low-quality middleware. Plan, test, implement, and document, and your middleware will enjoy more success.</p>

<p>If you do publish your own packages, here are the minimum things you should have:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Package name</dt>
<dd>
<p>While package naming is up to you, you obviously have to pick something that isn’t already taken, which can sometimes be a challenge.  npm packages now support namespacing by account, so you’re not competing globally for names.  If you’re writing middleware, it’s customary to prefix your package name with <code>connect-</code> or <code>express-</code>.  Catchy package names that don’t have any particular relation to what it does are fine, but even better is a package name that hints at what it does (a great example of a catchy but appropriate package name is <code>zombie</code>, for headless browser emulation).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Package description</dt>
<dd>
<p>Your package description should be short, concise, and descriptive.  This is one of the primary fields that is indexed when people search for packages, so it’s best to be descriptive, not clever (there’s room for some cleverness and humor in your documentation, don’t worry).</p>
</dd>
<dt>Author/contributors</dt>
<dd>
<p>Take some credit.  Go on.</p>
</dd>
<dt>License(s)</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is often neglected, and there is nothing more frustrating than encountering a package without a license (leaving you unsure of whether you can use it in your project).  Don’t be that person.  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="MIT license" id="idm45053571551160"/>The <a href="http://bit.ly/mit_license">MIT license</a> is an easy choice if you don’t want any restrictions on how your code is used.  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="GNU General Public License (GPL)" id="idm45053571549624"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="GPL (GNU General Public License)" id="idm45053571548904"/>If you want it to be open source (and stay open source), another popular choice is the <a href="http://bit.ly/gpl_license">GPL license</a>.  It’s also wise to include license files in the root directory of your project (they should start with <em>LICENSE</em>).  For maximum coverage, dual-license with MIT and GPL.  For an example of this in <em>package.json</em> and in <em>LICENSE</em> files, see my <a href="http://bit.ly/connect-bundle"><code>connect-bundle</code> package</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Version</dt>
<dd>
<p>For the versioning system to work, you need to version your packages.  Note that npm versioning is separate from commit numbers in your repository: you can update your repository all you like, but it won’t change what people get when they use npm to install your package.  You need to increment your version number and republish for changes to be reflected in the npm registry.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Dependencies</dt>
<dd>
<p>You should make an effort to be conservative about dependencies in your packages.  I’m not suggesting constantly reinventing the wheel, but dependencies increase the size and licensing complexity of your package.  At a minimum, you should make sure you aren’t listing dependencies that you don’t need.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Keywords</dt>
<dd>
<p>Along with description, keywords are the other major metadata used for people trying to find your package, so choose appropriate keywords.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Repository</dt>
<dd>
<p>You should have one.  GitHub is the most common, but others are welcome.</p>
</dd>
<dt>README.md</dt>
<dd>
<p>The standard documentation format for both GitHub and npm is <a href="http://bit.ly/33IxnwS">Markdown</a>.  It’s an easy, wiki-like syntax that you can quickly learn.  Quality documentation is vitally important if you want your package to be used. If I land on an npm page and there’s no documentation, I usually just skip it without further investigation.  At a minimum, you should describe basic usage (with examples).  Even better is to have all options documented.  Describing how to run tests goes the extra mile.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>When you’re ready to publish your own package, the process is quite easy.  Register for a free <a href="https://npmjs.org/signup">npm account</a> and then follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Type <code>npm adduser</code>, and log in with your npm credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type <code>npm publish</code> to publish your package.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>That’s it!  You’ll probably want to create a project from scratch, and test your package by using <code>npm install</code>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc7" id="idm45053571530824"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc6" id="idm45053571530024"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc5" id="idm45053571529336"/></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>It is my sincere hope that this book has given you all the tools you need to get started with this exciting technology stack.  At no time in my career have I felt so invigorated by a new technology (despite the odd main character that is JavaScript), and I hope I have managed to convey some of the elegance and promise of this stack.  Though I have been building websites professionally for many years, I feel that, thanks to Node and Express, I understand the way the internet works at a deeper level than I ever have before.  I believe that it’s a technology that truly enhances understanding, instead of trying to hide the details from you, all while still providing a framework for quickly and efficiently building websites.</p>

<p>Whether you are a newcomer to web development, or just to Node and Express, I welcome you to the ranks of JavaScript developers.  I look forward to seeing you at user groups and conferences, and most important, seeing what you will build.<a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc1" id="idm45053571525832"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-startref="ix_ch-23-additional_resources-asciidoc0" id="idm45053571525112"/></p>
