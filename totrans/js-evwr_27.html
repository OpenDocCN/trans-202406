<p>Here in the United States it’s common to give a new high school graduate a copy of Dr. Suess’s <em>Oh the Places You’ll Go!</em> as a graduation gift.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Congratulations!&#13;
Today is your day.&#13;
You’re off to Great Places!&#13;
You’re off and away!</p></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’ve made it to the end of this book, a bit of a graduation celebration feels appropriate. We’ve covered a lot of material, from building a GraphQL API with Node through several types of UI clients, but we’ve only scratched the surface. Each of these topics fills books and countless online tutorials on its own. I hope that rather than feeling overwhelmed, you now feel equipped to more deeply explore the topics that interest you and build amazing things.</p>&#13;

<p>JavaScript is the little programming language that could. What was once a humble “toy language” is now the most popular programming language in the world. The result is that knowing how to write JavaScript is a superpower that enables us to build nearly any sort of application for any platform. Given that it’s a superpower, I’ll leave you with <a href="https://oreil.ly/H02ca">one last cliche</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>…with great power there must also come — great responsibility!</p></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Technology can, and should, be a force for good. My hope is that you are able to apply the things you’ve learned in this book toward making the world a better place. That may include taking on a new job or side project that enables a better life for your family, teaching others new skills, or building a product designed to bring happiness or improve the lives of others. Whatever it may be, when you wield your powers for good, we are all better off.</p>&#13;
