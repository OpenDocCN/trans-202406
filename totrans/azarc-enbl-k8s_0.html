<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>In the world of tech and cloud, several technologies are growing at an extremely fast pace, including multicloud, containers, Kubernetes, and DevOps. With the need to adopt containers and Kubernetes for running workloads as well as the capability to run these across on-premises and multiple clouds, we’re seeing new tools and technology patterns created to streamline this for technical teams. Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is one of those tools, and GitOps is one of those technology patterns. Like the growth of cloud, containers, and Kubernetes, we’re going to see exponential growth of Azure Arc and GitOps. It’s only a matter of time.</p>

<p>In this report, you’ll find background on the needs that drove the creation of Azure Arc and GitOps. You’ll learn what Azure Arc is, how it can be used, and how to use it. You’ll also learn what GitOps is and how it fits into the Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes offering. This report is a great first step in your journey with Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes and GitOps.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments </h1>

<p>First and foremost, thanks to God for continued blessings and opportunities like this. Thank you to my wife, Aya, and my sons for being patient with me and giving me the time to pursue opportunities like this.</p>

<p>I would also like to thank the team at O’Reilly, Michele Cronin and Jennifer Pollock, for being great and easy to work with.</p>

<p>Thanks to Chris Sanders and the Arc team at Microsoft for building this exciting technology.</p>

<p>A huge thanks to Michael Levan for doing the technical review on this publication and ensuring what I created is technically sound.</p>

<p>I would like to give a shout out to the MVP and tech community at large for being awesome and sharing their passion for technology. It’s an honor to be a part of such a large tech community.</p>
