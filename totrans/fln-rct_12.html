<h1><span class="label">Chapter 11. </span>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’ve made it this far, thank you for joining me on this journey&#13;
through the React ecosystem. I hope you’ve enjoyed this adventure as&#13;
much as I have. In our time together, we pursued a deeper understanding&#13;
of React, exploring its core principles, inner workings, and broader ecosystem. Assuming we already know how to <em>use</em> React, we&#13;
focused on understanding its mechanism: how it&#13;
actually works—with the end goal being practical takeaways we can use in&#13;
our engineering careers going &#13;
<span class="keep-together">forward.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Takeaways" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id172">&#13;
<h1>Takeaways</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s outline some of those takeaways now:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Rethink best practices.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Sometimes, we need to rethink everything. React’s introduction of JSX&#13;
and the virtual DOM was a radical departure from the status quo. It&#13;
challenged the established conventions and forced us to rethink how we&#13;
build interfaces. This willingness to challenge the status quo and&#13;
reimagine the way things are done is a hallmark of React’s philosophy,&#13;
and thus as engineers, we should always be willing to challenge the&#13;
status quo and rethink the way things are done.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Fully understand how JSX<a data-primary="JSX (JavaScript Syntax eXtension)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1149"/> works.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>If we’re limited by a programming language—as in, if we can’t have&#13;
HTML-style syntax in JavaScript—we as engineers have the power to change&#13;
that by creating a new language. This is what JSX is: a new&#13;
language that compiles down to JavaScript. We can do this too now that&#13;
we fully understand how JSX works and some compiler theory.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Constraints are not a bad thing.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Constraints are the mother of invention. React is fundamentally an&#13;
innovation born out of the constraints of the web, where reading&#13;
<code>innerWidth</code> of an element causes a reflow, and where different browsers&#13;
have different APIs for events. The takeaway here is that constraints are&#13;
not a bad thing. They force us to think outside the box and come up with&#13;
creative solutions.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Declarative abstractions<a data-primary="declarative programming" data-secondary="power of" data-type="indexterm" id="id1150"/><a data-primary="React" data-secondary="and declarative programming" data-secondary-sortas="declarative programming" data-type="indexterm" id="id1151"/> unlock powerful capabilities.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>By decoupling the expression of JSX from the reconciler, React pioneered a “write once, run anywhere” approach to UI development, allowing us to use the same code to render to the DOM, the server, or even a native platform. This is a powerful capability that we can leverage in our own projects as we consider separating concerns and landing on the right level of abstraction.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Unlocking powerful capabilities allows us to build more flexible and maintainable &#13;
<span class="keep-together">applications.</span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>We uncovered a number of patterns, from higher-order components to&#13;
render props to hooks to context. These patterns are powerful tools that&#13;
we can use to abstract logic, share behavior across components, and&#13;
manage state more effectively. While these patterns introduce&#13;
complexity, they also unlock powerful capabilities, allowing us to build&#13;
more flexible and maintainable applications. Moreover, like HOCs, these&#13;
patterns predate React. What patterns are we using today that will be&#13;
the foundation of the next generation of UI frameworks? What patterns&#13;
can we invent that will make our lives easier?</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Powerful capabilities can be leveraged in our own projects.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>We learned that when we go beyond the browser, through to the server,&#13;
a slew of new possibilities open up. We can render our React components&#13;
on the server, use the browser’s native fetch API to load data,&#13;
and we can use native HTML forms for user inputs. These are powerful&#13;
capabilities that we can leverage in our own projects as we consider the&#13;
trade-offs of server-side rendering<a data-primary="server-side rendering (SSR)" data-type="indexterm" id="id1152"/> and the benefits of leveraging the&#13;
web’s fundamentals.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>The benefits of improving user experience.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>We now are empowered to take full advantage of React’s concurrent&#13;
features, such as <code>useTransition</code>, to improve user experience by&#13;
deferring work to be done “in an alternate universe” and then&#13;
committing the changes to the DOM when they’re ready. This is a powerful&#13;
capability that we can leverage in our own projects as we consider the&#13;
trade-offs of deferring work and the benefits of improving user&#13;
experience.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>All this is done in a language that we know and understand.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>We explored the intricacies between Next.js and Remix through the lens&#13;
of creating our own framework, ultimately recognizing that all of this&#13;
is just JavaScript with some servers and things: we can build our own&#13;
framework, too, given enough time and resources. While we’re thankful for&#13;
the work of the authors, we can also be empowered that all of this is&#13;
done in a language that we know and understand.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Ship drastically less code to our users.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Similar to going beyond the browser to the server, we learned that&#13;
going beyond the browser to the bundler unlocks an entire new world of&#13;
possibilities, leveraging the bundler to split client components from&#13;
server components and ship drastically less code to our users. What&#13;
other cool compiler/bundler tricks can we use to improve our users’&#13;
experience?</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>We can take inspiration from these other frameworks and apply them to our own projects.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>We zoomed out and looked at how even outside React,&#13;
everyone’s sort of solving the same problem: how do we build user&#13;
interfaces well, that are fast, responsive, reactive, and also come with&#13;
great developer experience? We explored some ideas from Vue, Solid,&#13;
Qwik, and more, and we learned that we can take inspiration from these&#13;
other frameworks and apply them to our own projects.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As we draw the curtains on our exploration of React.js, it’s essential&#13;
to reflect on the journey we’ve taken and understand the transformative&#13;
nature of this library. React’s growth over the years stands as a&#13;
testament to its adaptability, resilience, and the innovative spirit of&#13;
its community. From introducing a more intuitive way of building&#13;
interfaces with JSX, to reimagining how updates can be more efficient&#13;
with the virtual DOM, React has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on&#13;
the landscape of web &#13;
<span class="keep-together">development.</span></p>&#13;
</div></section>&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Our Timeline" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id173">&#13;
<h1>Our Timeline</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The initial chapters of this book presented a gentle introduction to the&#13;
core principles of React. At its heart, React’s philosophy is about&#13;
building components that make updates to web experiences more&#13;
approachable, scalable, and maintainable. These self-contained units of&#13;
work—components, fibers, elements—encapsulate both the logic and the UI,&#13;
making it easier to reason about our applications as they scale.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With JSX, React offers a declarative approach to UI development. By&#13;
making our interfaces a function of our application’s state, we can&#13;
easily understand and predict how changes in our data will affect our&#13;
UI. The clear separation and the single source of truth concept have&#13;
undoubtedly changed how developers approach UI &#13;
<span class="keep-together">construction.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As React gained traction, its influence inevitably rippled through the&#13;
tech industry, inspiring many platforms and frameworks. One of the most&#13;
noteworthy influenced platforms is Apple’s SwiftUI<a data-primary="SwiftUI" data-type="indexterm" id="id1153"/><a data-primary="Apple’s SwiftUI" data-type="indexterm" id="id1154"/>, a framework for&#13;
building user interfaces across all Apple devices.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Influenced by React and others, SwiftUI adopted a similar philosophy.&#13;
Instead of the classic MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern often&#13;
seen in iOS development, SwiftUI encourages developers to build UIs&#13;
using smaller, component-like structures called views. Each view in&#13;
SwiftUI is a self-contained unit, much like React &#13;
<span class="keep-together">components.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As UI frameworks continue to evolve, the cross-pollination of ideas will&#13;
persist. Innovations from one platform can inspire improvements in&#13;
another, leading to a richer, more cohesive development landscape.&#13;
React’s influence on SwiftUI and the broader ecosystem is a prime&#13;
example of this symbiotic relationship, and it sets the stage for future&#13;
collaborations and inspirations in the tech world.</p>&#13;

<h1>The Mechanics Behind the Magic</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The virtual DOM and the Fiber reconciler were some of the more&#13;
technical topics we delved into. These concepts are the gears and&#13;
pulleys behind React’s efficient and performant updates. The virtual DOM&#13;
acts as a mediator between our application’s state and the actual DOM.&#13;
By comparing differences and batching updates, React ensures that the&#13;
least amount of work is done to keep the UI in sync with the state.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The reconciler, on the other hand, is the brain behind this operation.&#13;
It decides when and how to update components, optimizing for performance&#13;
and ensuring consistency. We explored the inner workings of the&#13;
reconciler, learning about the different phases and the work that goes&#13;
into each one. We also looked at how the reconciler prioritizes work,&#13;
ensuring that the most important updates are processed first.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Advanced Adventures" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id265">&#13;
<h1>Advanced Adventures</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Venturing into the advanced terrains, we looked at advanced patterns&#13;
in React. These patterns, such as higher-order components, render props,&#13;
hooks, and context, allow developers to abstract logic, share behavior&#13;
across components, and manage state more effectively. While these&#13;
patterns introduce complexity, they also unlock powerful capabilities,&#13;
allowing us to build more flexible and maintainable applications.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Server-side React and concurrent React took us on a journey through the&#13;
evolution of React applications. With the increasing need for fast&#13;
initial loads and interactive experiences, leveraging the server and&#13;
async operations has become vital. These techniques ensure our&#13;
applications remain snappy, responsive, and user-centric.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We explored the server side of <code>react-dom</code>, including functions like&#13;
<code>renderToString</code> and <code>renderToPipeableStream</code>, outlining the trade-offs&#13;
of each. We also explored some of React’s asynchronous capabilities,&#13;
such as <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> and <code>useTransition</code>, and how they can be&#13;
used to improve the user experience.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, we dipped our toes into React Server Components, a more&#13;
recent addition to the React ecosystem that represents the library’s&#13;
continued evolution. By enabling components to be rendered on the server&#13;
only, we can create more efficient applications, optimizing for both&#13;
performance and user experience.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In our final chapters, we explored the broader ecosystem surrounding&#13;
React with the frameworks and the alternative libraries. React’s&#13;
success has spawned a plethora of tools, frameworks, and alternatives,&#13;
each bringing its own set of advantages and trade-offs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>React has come a long way since its inception, and its journey is a&#13;
reflection of the ever-evolving world of web development. As you’ve&#13;
journeyed through this book, you’ve not only learned about a library but&#13;
have also gained insight into the paradigms and principles that drive&#13;
modern web development.</p>&#13;

<dt>Experiment with different frameworks.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Nothing beats hands-on&#13;
experience when it comes to understanding a tool. Allocating some time&#13;
to build small projects or prototypes with different frameworks can&#13;
provide invaluable insights. This can help you understand the strengths&#13;
and weaknesses of each framework and how they fit with your development&#13;
style and project requirements.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Build in public.</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Popularized by Shawn Wang (<em>@swyx</em>), probably the best way to&#13;
stay up-to-date is to build in public. This means sharing your work,&#13;
thoughts, and ideas with the community. This can be as simple&#13;
as posting on social media about your work, or as involved as writing a&#13;
blog post or creating a YouTube video. By sharing your work, you can get&#13;
feedback from the community, which can help you improve your skills and&#13;
gain a deeper understanding of the tools you’re using.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Writing a book has been a great way for me to learn React. I’ve learned&#13;
so much from the community, and I’ve been able to share my knowledge&#13;
with others<a data-startref="ix_Reacttipsforstayinguptodate.11.197.8" data-type="indexterm" id="id1155"/>. I highly recommend it!</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As we conclude, remember that learning React isn’t just about mastering&#13;
a library; it’s about embracing a mindset. A mindset of component-driven&#13;
development, performance optimization, and continuously adapting&#13;
to the ever-changing demands of the web.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The future of web development is bright, and React, along with its&#13;
community, will undoubtedly play a significant role in shaping it.&#13;
Whether you’re a seasoned developer or someone just starting out, the skills&#13;
and knowledge you’ve acquired from this book will serve you well as you&#13;
continue your journey in the vast and exciting realm of web development.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Here’s to building more intuitive, performant, and user-centric&#13;
applications with React. Cheers to the future, and thank you for being a&#13;
part of this adventure!</p>&#13;
