<h1>Part II Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Performance and scalability<a data-primary="database systems" data-secondary="performance and scalability of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46466884693096"/> are important properties of any database system. The storage engine and node-local read-write path can have a larger impact on <em>performance</em> of the system: how quickly it can process requests locally. At the same time, a subsystem responsible for communication in the cluster often has a larger impact on the <em>scalability</em> of the database system: maximum cluster size and capacity. However, the storage engine can only be used for a limited number of use cases if it’s not scalable and its performance degrades as the dataset grows. At the same time, putting a slow atomic commit protocol on top of the fastest storage engine will not yield good results.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Distributed, cluster-wide, and node-local processes are interconnected, and have to be considered holistically. When designing a database system, you have to consider how different subsystems fit and work together.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Part II began with a discussion of how distributed systems are different from single-node applications, and which difficulties are to be expected in such environments.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We discussed the basic distributed system building blocks, different consistency models, and several important classes of distributed algorithms, some of which can be used to implement these consistency models:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Failure detection</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Identify remote process failures accurately and efficiently.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Leader election</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Quickly and reliably choose a single process to temporarily serve as a coordinator.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Dissemination</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Reliably distribute information using peer-to-peer communication.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Anti-entropy</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Identify and repair state divergence between the nodes.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Distributed transactions</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Execute series of operations against multiple partitions atomically.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Consensus</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Reach an agreement between remote participants while tolerating process <span class="keep-together">failures.</span></p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These algorithms are used in many database systems, message queues, schedulers, and other important infrastructure software. Using the knowledge from this book, you’ll be able to better understand how they work, which, in turn, will help to make better decisions about which software to use, and identify potential problems.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="other_sources">Further Reading</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At the end of each chapter, you can find resources related to the material presented in the chapter. Here, you’ll find books you can address for further study, covering both concepts mentioned in this book and other concepts. This list is not meant to be complete, but these sources contain a lot of important and useful information relevant for database systems enthusiasts, some of which is not covered in this book:</p>&#13;
