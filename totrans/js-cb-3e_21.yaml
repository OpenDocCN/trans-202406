    the environment provides. It’s simple to download and install any number of Node

    JavaScript *modularization*. Modularizing ensures that external functionality
    is created in such a way that it isn’t dependent on other external functionality,
    a concept known as *loose coupling*. This means I can use a `Foo` module, without
    having to include a `Bar` module, because `Foo` is tightly dependent on having
    `Bar` included.

    comes in having to follow certain mandated criteria in order for external code
    to participate in the module system. The contract is between you, me, and other
    JavaScript developers: we’re following an agreed-on path when we produce (or consume)
    external functionality in a module system, and we all have expectations based
    on the module system.'

- en: 'A *unit test* is a way that developers test their code to ensure it meets the
    specifications. It involves testing functional behavior, and seeing what happens
    when you send bad arguments—or no arguments at all. It’s called unit testing because
    it’s used with individual units of code, such as testing one module in a Node
    application, as compared to testing the entire Node application. It becomes one
    part of *integration testing*, where all the pieces are plugged together, before
    going to *user acceptance testing*: testing to ensure that the application does
    what users expect it to do (and that they generally don’t hate it when they use
    it).'

    you first start, but can soon become second nature. A good goal is to develop
    both tests and code in parallel to one another. Many developers even practice
    *test-driven development*, where unit tests are written prior to the code itself.
