    that users will love. In the React space in particular, there’s a wealth of material
    available to you, and that’s part of the problem. Not all of it is consistent,
    and you have to make your own path wading through all of the tutorials and blog
    posts available, hoping you’ll piece together a curriculum that is free of contradictions
    and won’t leave gaping holes in your knowledge. And you’ll always worry that what
    you’re learning is out of date.

- en: This is where Tejas Kumar comes in with this book. Tejas has had years of React
    experience and has gone to great lengths to go in depth on topics that will give
    you a solid foundation of knowledge. He’s an experienced engineer and fountain
    of knowledge that will help you feel confident with React. I have been blessed
    to associate with Tejas over the years in various capacities in open source, conference
    speaking, educational content creation, and on a personal level, and I hope you
    understand you hold in your hand a book that has been crafted by a talented individual
    who is also a fantastic person.

    to that will help you “think in React” with the proper mental model. You’ll come
    to understand the purpose of React’s existence in the first place, which will
    give you a good frame of reference when considering React as a tool to solve problems.
    React wasn’t invented in a vacuum, and understanding the origin story will help
    you know the problems React is intended to solve so you can avoid putting a round
    peg in a square hole.

    and concurrent React, which will help you use this tool more efficiently. I’ve
    always believed that the best way to level up your experience with a tool is to
    understand how the tool works. So even if you’ve been using React for years at
    this point, these sections will open your mind to new possibilities and understanding
    as you come to really *understand* React, rather than just piecing things together
    and hoping (fingers crossed) the result is positive.

- en: You’ll discover patterns that the pros use to build effective and powerful abstractions.
    React itself is a very fast UI library, but there are times when you’re building
    complex applications that you’ll need to reach for performance optimizations,
    and Tejas will show you how with the memoization, lazy loading, and state management
    techniques available in React. Beyond that, you’ll understand how the best libraries
    in the ecosystem work with patterns like compound components, render props, prop
    getters, state reducers, and control props. These are critical tools in your tool
    belt as you build React applications. Even if you’re just using off-the-shelf
    solutions, understanding how those powerful abstractions work will help you use
    them more effectively.

- en: Tejas goes beyond theoretical React though, and you’ll be introduced to practical
    frameworks like Remix and Next.js that will be important for you to take advantage
    of React’s full stack capabilities to make the best user experience possible.
    With React’s server rendering capabilities since the beginning, you can take control
    of your own destiny as you use React to build your entire user experience on both
    the frontend and the backend. And you’ll also get to know the leading edge tech,
    like Server Components and Server Actions, that React is using to level up the
    user experience.

  zh: Tejas 不仅限于理论性的 React，你还将了解到像 Remix 和 Next.js 这样的实用框架，这些框架对于充分利用 React 的全栈能力，以提供最佳用户体验至关重要。从
    React 的服务端渲染能力开始，你可以掌控自己的命运，将 React 用于前端和后端，构建整个用户体验。此外，你还将了解到 React 正在使用的 Server
    Components 和 Server Actions 等前沿技术，以提升用户体验的水平。
- en: I’m confident that after reading what Tejas has put together for you, you’ll
    have the knowledge you need to be successful at building exceptional applications
    with React. I wish you the very best on your learning experience with React, the
    most widely used UI library in the world. Enjoy the journey!
