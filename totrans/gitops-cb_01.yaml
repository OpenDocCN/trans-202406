- en: We wrote this book for builders. Whether you are a developer, DevOps engineer,
    site reliability engineer (SRE), or platform engineer dealing with Kubernetes,
    you are building some good stuff. We would like to share our experience from what
    we have learned in the field and in the community about the latest Kubernetes
    automation insights for pipelines and CI/CD workloads. The book contains a comprehensive
    list of the most popular available software and tools in the Kubernetes and cloud
    native ecosystem for this purpose. We aim to provide a list of practical recipes
    that might help your daily job or are worth exploring further. We are not sticking
    to a particular technology or project for implementing Kubernetes automation.
    However, we are opinionated on some of our choices to deliver a concise GitOps
    pathway.

    these recipes valuable and inspiring for your projects!

    of containers and why they are essential for application development and deployment
    today. Kubernetes is a container-orchestration platform; however, it doesn’t build
    containers out of the box. Therefore, we’ll provide a list of practical recipes
    for making container apps with the most popular tools available in the cloud native
    community.'

    you will likely work with today and tomorrow following the GitOps approach.'
