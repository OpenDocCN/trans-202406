    Asynchronous replication has a small effect on write performance because data
    changes are written and flushed to binary logs on transaction commit—but after
    that, there’s no effect. Semisynchronous replication has a greater effect on write
    performance: it attenuates transaction throughput to network latency because every
    commit must be acknowledged by at least one replica. Since network latency measures
    in milliseconds, the effect on write performance is noticeable, but it’s a worthwhile
    trade-off because it guarantees that no committed transactions are lost, which
    is not true for asynchronous replication. Group Replication is more complex and

    From [“Sharding: A Brief Introduction”](#sharding-intro), the four-year fit is
    an estimate of data size or access in four years applied to the capacity of your
    hardware *today*. Sharding might not be required if the estimated data size or
    access fits (figuratively) within your hardware capacity today. (Refer back to
    [“Application Workload”](#scale-up-app-workload) for the discussion of hardware
    fit.)'

    has historically increased by 10 GB every month, then the database will be 12
    months × 4 years × 10 GB/month = 480 GB *larger* in four years—if no data is deleted
    or archived (see [“Delete or Archive Data”](ch03.html#delete-or-archive)). If
    the database is 100 GB today, then 580 GB in four years fits: you don’t need to
    shard any time soon (four-year fit for access load notwithstanding) because MySQL
    on hardware *today* can easily handle 580 GB of data.'

    take it seriously and dive deeper to determine for sure: is the database on a
    steady path to becoming too large for a single MySQL instance? If yes, then *shard
    early* because sharding is essentially a complex data migration process; therefore,
    the less data, the easier the process. If not, then congratulations: ensuring
    that the system will continue to scale for years to come is an expert practice
    in all fields of engineering.'
