&#13;
&#13;
<p>What<a data-primary="React" data-secondary="introduction to" data-tertiary="benefits of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901659211736"/> makes a JavaScript library good? Is it the number of stars on&#13;
GitHub? The number of downloads on npm? Is the number of tweets that&#13;
ThoughtLeaders™ write about it on a daily basis important? How do we&#13;
pick the best tool to use to build the best thing? How do we know it’s&#13;
worth our time? How do we know it’s good?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When React was first released, there was a lot of conversation around&#13;
whether it was good, and there were many skeptics. It was new, and&#13;
the new can often be upsetting.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To respond to these critiques, Pete Hunt from the React team wrote an&#13;
article called “Why React?” that recommended that you “give it [React]&#13;
five minutes.” He wanted to encourage people to work with React first&#13;
before thinking that the team’s approach was too wild.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Yes, React is a small library that doesn’t come with everything you&#13;
might need out of the box to build your application. Give it five&#13;
minutes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Yes, in React, you write code that looks like HTML right in your&#13;
JavaScript code. And yes, those tags require preprocessing to run in a&#13;
browser. And you’ll probably need a build tool like webpack for that.&#13;
Give it five minutes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As React approaches a decade of use, a lot of teams decided that&#13;
it’s good because they gave it five minutes. We’re talking Uber,&#13;
Twitter, Airbnb, and Twitter—huge companies that tried React and realized&#13;
that it could help teams build better products faster. At the end of the&#13;
day, isn’t that what we’re all here for? Not for the tweets. Not for the&#13;
stars. Not for the downloads. We’re here to build cool stuff with tools&#13;
that we like to use. We’re here for the glory of shipping stuff that we’re proud to say we built. If you like doing those types of things,&#13;
you’ll probably like working with React.</p>&#13;

<h1>A Strong Foundation</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Whether<a data-primary="React" data-secondary="introduction to" data-tertiary="approach to learning" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901659204456"/> you’re brand new to React or looking to this text to learn some&#13;
of the latest features, we want this book to serve as a strong&#13;
foundation for all your future work with the library. The goal of&#13;
this book is to avoid confusion in the learning process by putting&#13;
things in a sequence: a learning roadmap.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Before digging into React, it’s important to know JavaScript. Not all of&#13;
JavaScript, not every pattern, but having a comfort with arrays, objects, and&#13;
functions before jumping into this book will be useful.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll look at newer JavaScript syntax to get you&#13;
acquainted with the latest JavaScript features, especially those that&#13;
are frequently used with React. Then we’ll give an introduction to&#13;
functional JavaScript so you can understand the paradigm that gave&#13;
birth to React. A nice side effect of working with React is that it can&#13;
make you a stronger JavaScript developer by promoting patterns that are&#13;
<span class="keep-together">readable</span>, reusable, and testable. Sort of like a gentle, helpful&#13;
brainwashing.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From there, we’ll cover foundational React knowledge to understand how&#13;
to build out a user interface with components. Then we’ll learn to&#13;
compose these components and add logic with props and state. We’ll cover&#13;
React Hooks, which allow us to reuse stateful logic between components.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once the basics are in place, we’ll build a new application that&#13;
allows users to add, edit, and delete colors. We’ll learn how Hooks&#13;
and Suspense can help us with data fetching. Throughout the construction&#13;
of that app, we’ll introduce a variety of tools from the broader React&#13;
ecosystem that are used to handle common concerns like routing, testing,&#13;
and server-side rendering.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We hope to get you up to speed with the React ecosystem faster by&#13;
approaching it this way—not just to scratch the surface, but to equip&#13;
you with the tools and skills necessary to build real-world React&#13;
applications.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="React’s Past and Future" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="reacts-past-and-future">&#13;
<h1>React’s Past and Future</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>React<a data-primary="React" data-secondary="introduction to" data-tertiary="history of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662654024"/> was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at&#13;
Facebook. It was incorporated into Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and later&#13;
on Instagram when it was acquired by Facebook in 2012. At JSConf 2013,&#13;
React was made open source, and it joined the crowded category of UI&#13;
libraries like jQuery, Angular, Dojo, Meteor, and others. At that time,&#13;
React was described as “the V in MVC.” In other words, <span class="keep-together">React components</span>&#13;
acted as the view layer or the user interface for your JavaScript&#13;
<span class="keep-together">applications</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From there, community adoption started to spread. In January 2015,&#13;
Netflix announced that they were using React to power their UI&#13;
development. Later that month, <a data-primary="React Native" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662650232"/>React Native, a library for building&#13;
mobile applications using React, was released. Facebook also released&#13;
ReactVR, another tool that brought React to a broader range of rendering&#13;
targets. In 2015 and 2016, a huge number of popular tools like React&#13;
Router, Redux, and Mobx came on the scene to handle tasks like routing&#13;
and state management. After all, React was billed as a library:&#13;
concerned with implementing a specific set of features, not providing a&#13;
tool for every use case.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another huge event on the timeline was the release of React Fiber in&#13;
2017. Fiber was a rewrite of React’s rendering algorithm that was sort&#13;
of magical in its execution. It was a full rewrite of React’s internals&#13;
that changed barely anything about the public API. It was a way of&#13;
making React more modern and performant without affecting its users.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>More recently in 2019, we saw the release of Hooks, a new way of adding&#13;
and sharing stateful logic across components. We also saw the release of&#13;
Suspense, a way to optimize asynchronous rendering with React.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In<a data-primary="React" data-secondary="future of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662647096"/> the future, we’ll inevitably see more change, but one of the&#13;
reasons for React’s success is the strong team that has worked on the&#13;
project over the years. The team is ambitious yet cautious, pushing&#13;
forward-thinking optimizations while constantly considering the impact&#13;
 any changes to the library will send cascading through the&#13;
community.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As<a data-primary="React" data-secondary="introduction to" data-tertiary="versions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662645208"/> changes are made to React and related tools, sometimes there are&#13;
breaking changes. In fact, future versions of these tools&#13;
may break some of the example code in this book. You can still follow&#13;
along with the code samples. We’ll provide exact version information in&#13;
the <em>package.json</em> file so that you can install these packages at the&#13;
correct version.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Beyond<a data-primary="React blog" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662642632"/> this book, you can stay on top of changes by following along with&#13;
the official <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog">React blog</a>. When&#13;
new versions of React are released, the core team will write a detailed&#13;
blog post and changelog about what’s new. The blog has also been&#13;
translated into an ever-expanding list of languages, so if English isn’t&#13;
your native language, you can find localized versions of the docs on the&#13;
<a href="https://reactjs.org/languages">languages page</a> of the docs site.</p>&#13;

<h2>Learning React: Second Edition Changes</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This<a data-primary="React" data-secondary="introduction to" data-tertiary="deprecated features" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662638344"/> is the second edition of <em>Learning React</em>. We felt it was important&#13;
to update the book because React has evolved quite a bit over the past&#13;
few years. We intend to focus on all the current best practices that&#13;
are advocated by the React team, but we’ll also share information&#13;
about deprecated React features. There’s a lot of React code that was&#13;
written years ago using old styles that still works well and must be&#13;
maintained. In all cases, we’ll make mention of these features in a&#13;
sidebar in case you find yourself working with legacy React&#13;
applications.</p>&#13;

your work on React projects. These tools are available as a browser&#13;
extension for Chrome and Firefox and as a standalone app for use with&#13;
Safari, IE, and React Native. Once<a data-primary="component trees" data-secondary="inspecting" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662864824"/> you install the dev tools, you’ll be&#13;
able to inspect the React component tree, view props and state details,&#13;
and even view which sites are currently using React in production. These&#13;
are really useful when debugging and when learning about how React is&#13;
used in other projects.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To install, head over to the&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/5tizT">GitHub repository</a>. There, you’ll&#13;
find links to the&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/Or3pH">Chrome</a>&#13;
 and <a href="https://oreil.ly/uw3uv">Firefox&#13;
extensions</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once installed, you’ll be able to see which sites are using React.&#13;
Anytime the React icon is illuminated in the browser toolbar as shown in&#13;
<a data-type="xref" href="#browser_toolbar">Figure 1-1</a>, you’ll know that the site has React on the page.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>Then, when you open the developer tools, there will be a new tab visible&#13;
called React, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#react_tab">Figure 1-2</a>. Clicking on that will show all the components that&#13;
make up the page you’re currently viewing.</p>&#13;

<h2>Installing Node.js</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Node.js<a data-primary="development environment" data-secondary="Node.js" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662852056"/><a data-primary="Node.js" data-secondary="installing" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662851048"/><a data-primary="React" data-secondary="development environment" data-tertiary="Node.js" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662850104"/> is a JavaScript runtime environment used to build full-stack&#13;
applications. Node is open source and can be installed on Windows,&#13;
macOS, Linux, and other platforms. We’ll be using Node in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#react-and-the-server">Chapter 12</a>&#13;
when we build an Express server.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You need to have Node installed, but you do not need to be a Node expert&#13;
in order to use React. If you’re not sure if Node.js is installed on&#13;
your machine, you can open a Terminal or Command Prompt window and type:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">node -v</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When you run this command, you should see a node version number returned&#13;
to you, ideally 8.6.2 or higher. If you type the command and see an&#13;
error message that says “Command not found,” Node.js is not installed.&#13;
This is easily fixed by installing Node.js from the&#13;
<a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js website</a>. Just go through the installer’s automated steps, and when you type in the <code>node -v</code> command again,&#13;
you’ll see the version number.</p>&#13;

manager. In the JavaScript community, engineers share open source code&#13;
projects to avoid having to rewrite frameworks, libraries, or helper&#13;
functions on their own. React itself is an example of a useful npm&#13;
library. We’ll use npm to install a variety of packages throughout this&#13;
book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Most<a data-primary="package.json file" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45901662838632"/> JavaScript projects you encounter today will contain an&#13;
assorted collection of files plus a <em>package.json</em> file. This file&#13;
describes the project and all its dependencies. If you run&#13;
<code>npm install</code> in the folder that contains the <em>package.json</em> file, npm&#13;
will install all the packages listed in the project.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you’re starting your own project from scratch and want to include&#13;
dependencies, simply run the command:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">npm init -y</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This will initialize the project and create a <em>package.json</em> file. From&#13;
there, you can install your own dependencies with npm. To install a&#13;
package with npm, you’ll run:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">npm install package-name</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To remove a package with npm, you’ll run:</p>&#13;

It was released in 2016 by Facebook in&#13;
collaboration with Exponent, Google, and Tilde. The project helps&#13;
Facebook and other companies manage their dependencies reliably. If&#13;
you’re familiar with the npm workflow, getting up to speed with Yarn is&#13;
fairly simple. First, install Yarn globally with npm:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">npm install -g yarn</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Then, you’re ready to install packages. When installing dependencies&#13;
from <em>package.json</em>, in place of <code>npm install</code>, you can run <code>yarn</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To install a specific package with <code>yarn</code>, run:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">yarn add package-name</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To remove a dependency, the command is familiar, too:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">yarn remove package-name</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Yarn is used in production by Facebook and is included in projects like&#13;
React, React Native, and Create React App. If you ever find a project&#13;
that contains a <em>yarn.lock</em> file, the project uses yarn. Similar to the&#13;
<code>npm install</code> command, you can install all the dependencies of the&#13;
project by typing <code>yarn</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now that you have your environment set up for React development, you’re ready to start walking the path of learning React. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#javascript-for-react">Chapter 2</a>, we’ll get up to speed with the latest JavaScript syntax that’s most commonly found in React code.</p>&#13;
