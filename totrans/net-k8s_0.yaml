- en: Since the first two computers were joined together over a cable, networking
    has been a crucial part of our infrastructure. Networks now have layers and layers
    of complexity to support a multitude of use cases, and the advent of containers
    and projects like Mesosphere and Kubernetes have not changed that. While the contributors
    of Kubernetes have attempted to abstract away this networking complexity for developers,
    computer science is just that, abstraction upon abstraction. Kubernetes, and its
    networking API, is another abstraction that makes it easier and faster to deploy
    applications for consumption. What about the administrator who has to manage Kubernetes?
    This book intends to dispel the mysticism around the abstractions Kubernetes puts
    in place, guide administrators through the layers of complexity, and help you
    realize Kubernetes is not just another packet.

- en: According to [451 Research](https://oreil.ly/2SlsD), the global application
    container market is expected to grow from USD 2.1 billion in 2019 to USD 4.2 billion
    by 2022 . This explosive growth in the container market underscores the need for
    IT professionals to be knowledgeable in deploying, managing, and troubleshooting
    containers.

- en: This book is intended to be read from beginning to end by new network, Linux,
    or cluster administrators, and it can be used by more experienced DevOps engineers
    to jump to specific topics for which they find themselves needing to be upskilled.
    Network, Linux, and cluster administrators need to be familiar with how to operate
    Kubernetes at scale.

- en: In this book, readers will find the information required to navigate the layers
    of complexity that come with running a Kubernetes network. This book will peel
    back the abstractions that Kubernetes puts in place so that developers have a
    similar experience across deployments on-premises, in the cloud, and with managed
    services. Engineers responsible for production cluster operations and network
    uptime can use this book to bridge the gap in their knowledge of those abstractions.
