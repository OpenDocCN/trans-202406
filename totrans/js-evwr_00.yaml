- en: In 1997 I was a junior in high school. A friend and I were goofing around with
    the web-connected computer in our school library when he showed me that you could
    click View → Source to see the underlying code of a web page. A few days later,
    another friend showed me how to publish my own HTML. My mind was blown.

    liked to construct my own Franken-site. I spent much of my free time at the pieced-together
    computer in my family’s dining room tinkering away. I even “wrote” (OK, copied
    and pasted) my first JavaScript, to implement hover styles on links, which was
    not yet doable with simple CSS.

- en: And in a turn of events that I’ve come to think of as a nerdy and wholesome
    version of the film *Almost Famous*, my homegrown music site gained reasonable
    popularity. Because of this, I received promotional CDs in the mail and was put
    on the guest list at concerts. More important to me, however, was that I was sharing
    my interests with other people around the world. I was a bored suburban teenager,
    in love with music, and was able to reach people I’d never meet. That was, and
    still is, such an empowering feeling.

- en: Today, we can build powerful applications using only web technologies, but it
    can be daunting to get started. APIs are an invisible background that serves up
    data. View → Source shows concatenated and minified code. Authentication and security
    are mystifying. Putting all of these things together can be overwhelming. If we’re
    able to look beyond these confusing details, we may notice that the same technologies
    I was fiddling with 20-some years ago can now be used to build powerful web applications,
    code native mobile applications, create powerful desktop applications, design
    3D animations, and even program robots.

- en: As an educator, I’ve found that many of us learn best by building new things,
    taking them apart, and adapting them for our own use cases. That is the goal of
    this book. If you know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but are unsure of how to
    take those components and build the robust applications that you’ve dreamed up,
    this book is for you. I’ll guide you through building an API that can power the
    user interfaces of a web application, a native mobile application, and a desktop
    application. Most importantly, you’ll gain an understanding of how all of these
    pieces fit together so that you can build and create wonderful things.
