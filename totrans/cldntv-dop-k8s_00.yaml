- en: I was fortunate to be introduced to Kubernetes (and containers) fairly early
    in their lifetime. Whilst leading the DevOps practice for a boutique consultancy,
    I saw the potential for containers to bring huge benefits to a lot of our clients.
    That excitement and interest led me to take a role at Docker Inc., where I witnessed
    firsthand some of the incredible innovations taking shape in the burgeoning cloud
    native world.

    of the project at Google, later acquired by VMware) to focus on helping clients
    and the community learn and deploy it successfully. Because of this experience,
    I sometimes forget that many folks are just now exploring and adopting these technologies
    and their capabilities for the first time.

    Kubernetes to automatically provision a cloud load balancer, register the appropriate
    DNS name, and attach the relevant TLS certificate for their application to be
    publicly accessible. “That’s SO cool!” was their response to our success, and
    captures perfectly the feelings I experienced when first discovering and learning
    Kubernetes. Unfortunately, as with almost any advanced technology, it’s not all
    sunshine and roses.

- en: One of the criticisms oft-leveled at Kubernetes is that it’s *complicated*,
    which (in my mind, at least!) seems to carry a negative connotation. I disagree,
    and prefer to describe it as *necessarily complex*. Kubernetes has many moving
    parts, all working together to construct an application platform that can provide
    resiliency, efficiency, and extensibility at the highest scale. It encapsulates
    shared knowledge and saves us all the time and effort of reimplementing a lot
    of the common functionality that it provides.

    a vast array of functionality, not to mention the plethora of associated tools
    that exist in the wider cloud native ecosystem. For this reason, one of my favorite
    things about *Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes* is that the authors have assumed
    no prior knowledge. This really is a volume I would have loved in this space when
    I was starting out, awestruck and bewildered at the vast possibilities in front
    of me!

- en: Once you flip the page, you’ll begin by understanding the historical and cultural
    context behind DevOps and Kubernetes before being introduced to practical examples
    that are easy to follow and directly relevant to implementing these technologies
    in real-world scenarios. Therefore, whereas some titles are more reference-like
    in their approach, I recommend that you read this book in order.

- en: Justin and John have done a great job crafting a narrative that builds on what
    has come before. New concepts are deployed in a layered way, allowing you to “explore”
    them in greater depth as you progress. Even so, upon completing the book it can
    absolutely be used as a concise reference to key everyday concepts that you’ll
    find yourself turning to over and over again.

- en: Owing to a balanced mix of hands-on examples and pragmatic business advice,
    I often find myself recommending this book as the “one-stop shop” to prime both
    architects and engineers with the knowledge they need to understand the cloud
    native landscape and start their journey toward deploying a successful Kubernetes
    application platform.

- en: The first edition of *Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes* was released over
    three years ago, a veritable lifetime in the cloud native technology space. Not
    only have existing technologies and paradigms evolved (and in some cases been
    deprecated), but new ones have emerged. Building on the first edition, Justin
    has again applied his extensive hands-on experience to enhance the original guidance
    while maintaining the great combination of sound advice, breadth of coverage,
    and practical examples.

- en: My experience has taught me that there is no such thing as “best practice,”
    and that every situation is driven by nuanced constraints, which can prove challenging
    to negotiate. Justin’s experience as a practitioner working with these tools *on
    a daily basis* shines through in every section and will help you navigate the
    inevitable trade-offs and tough decisions as you choose what to adopt, and the
    best way of doing so, for your organization and/or use-cases.

    DevOps and Kubernetes journey. Allow me to congratulate you for taking your first
    steps; you are in for a rewarding and exhilarating ride!
