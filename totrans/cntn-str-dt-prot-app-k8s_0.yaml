- en: This report is for DevOps engineers, platform architects, site reliability teams,
    and application owners with a vested interest in managing storage for Kubernetes
    applications and services. The following pages provide a discussion of the challenges
    of data storage for distributed applications at scale, how to solve them, and
    considerations for moving to Kubernetes.

- en: The first chapter outlines the reasons why adopting Kubernetes in an enterprise
    production environment is complex, focusing on how traditional storage fails to
    meet the needs of modern cloud native applications. A discussion of Kubernetes
    storage primitives follows, including the Container Storage Interface and a brief
    explanation of how software-defined storage can support Kubernetes workloads.
    Following this foundation, the remaining chapters enumerate enterprise data needs
    and strategies for meeting them with Kubernetes storage. Topics include topology
    strategies for scale and efficiency, security, and the challenges of data protection.
