<h1 class="calibre7">Preface</h1>


<p class="author1">Service meshes need a little reputational rehab.</p>

<p class="author1">Many cloud native practitioners seem<a data-primary="service meshes" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="id336" class="calibre4"/> to have in mind that meshes are
frightening, complex things, things to be avoided until examined as a last
resort to save a dying application. We’d love to change that: service meshes
are incredible tools for making developing and operating cloud native
applications dramatically easier than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p class="author1">And, of course, we think Linkerd is the best mesh out there at making things
easy for people.</p>

<p class="author1">So if you’ve been tearing your hair out trying to understand a misbehaving
application based just on its logs, or if you’ve spent months trying to get
some other mesh running and you <em class="hyperlink">just want things to work</em>, or if you’re
trying to explain to yet another developer why they really don’t need to worry
about coding retries and mTLS into their microservice…you’re in the right
place. We’re glad you’re here.</p>






<section data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book" data-type="sect1" class="preface"><div class="preface" id="id303">
<h1 class="calibre8">Who Should Read This Book</h1>

<p class="author1">This book is meant to help anyone who thinks it’s easier to get things
done when creating, running, or debugging microservices applications, and is
looking to Linkerd to help with that. While we think that the book will
benefit people who are interested in Linkerd for its own sake, Linkerd—like computing itself—is ultimately a means,
not an end. This book reflects that.</p>

<p class="author1">Beyond that, it doesn’t matter to us whether you’re an application developer,
a cluster operator, a platform engineer, or whatever; there should be something in
here to help you get the most out of Linkerd. Our goal is to give you
everything you need to get Linkerd up and running to help you get things done.</p>

<p class="author1">You’ll need some basic knowledge of Kubernetes, the overall concept of running
things in containers, and the Unix command line to get the most out of this
book. Some familiarity with Prometheus, Helm, Jaeger, etc. will also be
helpful, but isn’t really critical.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Why We Wrote This Book" data-type="sect1" class="preface"><div class="preface" id="id304">
<h1 class="calibre8">Why We Wrote This Book</h1>

<p class="author1">We’ve both worked in the cloud native world for years and in software for many more
years before that. Across all that time, the challenge that has never gone away is
education; the coolest new thing on the block isn’t much good until people
really, truly understand what it is and how to use it.</p>

<p class="author1">Service meshes really should be pretty well understood by now, but of course
every month there are people who need to sort out the latest and greatest
changes in the meshes, and every month there are more people migrating to what
is, to them, the entirely new cloud native world. We wrote this book, and
we’ll keep updating it, to help all these people out.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Navigating This Book" data-type="sect1" class="preface"><div class="preface" id="id305">
<h1 class="calibre8">Navigating This Book</h1>

<p class="author1"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch01.html#LUAR_service_mesh_101" class="calibre4">Chapter 1, “Service Mesh 101”</a>, is an introduction to service meshes: what they
do, what they can help with, and why you might want to use one. This is a
must-read for folks who aren’t familiar with meshes.</p>

<p class="author1"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch02.html#LUAR_intro_to_linkerd" class="calibre4">Chapter 2, “Intro to Linkerd”</a>, takes a deep dive into Linkerd’s architecture
and history. If you’re familiar with Linkerd already, this may be mostly
recap.</p>

<p class="author1"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch03.html#LUAR_deploying_linkerd" class="calibre4">Chapter 3, “Deploying Linkerd”</a>, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch04.html#LUAR_meshing_workloads" class="calibre4">Chapter 4, “Adding Workloads to the Mesh”</a>, are all about
getting Linkerd running in a cluster and getting your application working
with Linkerd. These two chapters cover the basic nuts and bolts of actually
<em class="hyperlink">using</em> Linkerd. <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch05.html#LUAR_ingress_and_linkerd" class="calibre4">Chapter 5, “Ingress and Linkerd”</a>, continues by talking about the
ingress problem, how to manage it, and how Linkerd interacts with ingress
controllers.</p>

<p class="author1"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch06.html#LUAR_cli" class="calibre4">Chapter 6, “The Linkerd CLI”</a>, talks about the <code class="calibre9">linkerd</code> CLI, which you can use to
control and examine a Linkerd deployment.</p>

<p class="author1"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch07.html#LUAR_mtls_and_certs" class="calibre4">Chapter 7, “mTLS, Linkerd, and Certificates”</a>, dives deep into Linkerd mTLS and the way it uses
X.509 certificates. <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch08.html#LUAR_server_policy" class="calibre4">Chapter 8, “Linkerd Policy: Overview 
<span class="calibre">and Server-Based Policy</span>”</a>, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch09.html#LUAR_route_policy" class="calibre4">Chapter 9, “Linkerd Route-Based Policy”</a>, continue
by exploring how Linkerd can use those mTLS identities to enforce policy in
your cluster.</p>

<p class="author1"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch10.html#LUAR_observability" class="calibre4">Chapter 10, “Observing Your Platform with Linkerd”</a>, is all about Linkerd’s application-wide observability
mechanisms. <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch11.html#LUAR_reliability" class="calibre4">Chapter 11, “Ensuring Reliability with Linkerd”</a>, in turn, covers how to use Linkerd to
improve reliability within your application, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch12.html#LUAR_multicluster" class="calibre4">Chapter 12, “Multicluster Communication with Linkerd”</a>, talks
about extending a Linkerd mesh across multiple Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p class="author1"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch13.html#LUAR_cni_vs_init_containers" class="calibre4">Chapter 13, “Linkerd CNI Versus Init Containers”</a>, addresses the thorny topic of how, exactly,
you’ll have Linkerd interact with the low-level networking configuration of
your cluster. Unfortunately, this may be a necessary topic of discussion as
you consider taking Linkerd to production, which is the topic of
<a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch14.html#LUAR_production_ready" class="calibre4">Chapter 14, “Production-Ready Linkerd”</a>.</p>

<p class="author1">Finally, <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="chap-num-title" href="ch15.html#LUAR_troubleshooting" class="calibre4">Chapter 15, “Debugging Linkerd”</a>, discusses how to troubleshoot Linkerd
itself, should you find things misbehaving (even though we hope you won’t!).</p>
