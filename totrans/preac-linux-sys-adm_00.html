<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>I love to teach. Some of my earliest memories are of teaching other kids to do something—play chess, paint, or build forts for action figures. I taught other students in high school and college. Teaching is something I do naturally. When I write articles, whitepapers, or books, I adopt the role of a teacher. I place the reader in a classroom and teach them tasks or concepts, such as changing permissions on a file or adding a new user to a system. This is how my mind works. This book, like almost everything I write, is a manifestation of that almost innate desire to teach, pass on some knowledge, and plant a seed of curiosity that grows, blossoms, and spreads to others. I hope you find inspiration in this book that leads you to do the same.</p>

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>
<p>This book is for anyone who wants to explore Linux for the first time as a system administrator or for someone who wants to transition to such a role for work or as a serious hobby. It’s also meant for those preparing to take certification exams requiring some Linux knowledge.</p>

<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>
<p>I wrote this book to fill existing knowledge gaps for system administrators. I would have purchased this book for myself early in my career and kept it at my desk for reference. Sure, there’s plenty of technical information in the book, as you might expect, but there’s also career guidance and some coverage of the nontechnical aspects of being a system administrator.</p>

<h1 class="less_space">Acknowledgments</h1>
<p>Being a Linux system administrator requires sacrifices from you and your family. I’ve often stated that a sysadmin’s whole family works for a company. This might be true for any job you have, but it seems especially relevant for system administrators. Linux system administration is a great career choice, but take time for yourself, your spouse, and your children. Remember that you don’t live to work; you work to live. You can’t get missed moments back—the milestones, events, and celebrations that create an existence that will be remembered fondly.</p>
<p>Thank you to my wife, Melissa, who always supports my creative pursuits.</p>
