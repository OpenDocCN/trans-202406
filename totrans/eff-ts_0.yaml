- en: 'In the spring of 2016, I visited my old coworker Evan Martin at Google’s San
    Francisco office and asked him what he was excited about. I’d asked him this same
    question many times over the years because the answers were wide-ranging and unpredictable
    but always interesting: C++ build tools, Linux audio drivers, online crosswords,
    emacs plugins. This time, Evan was excited about TypeScript and Visual Studio
    Code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I was surprised! I’d heard of TypeScript before, but I knew only that it was
    created by Microsoft and that I mistakenly believed it had something to do with
    .NET. As a lifelong Linux user, I couldn’t believe that Evan had hopped on team
    Microsoft.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then Evan showed me vscode and the TypeScript playground and I was instantly
    converted. Everything was so fast, and the code intelligence made it easy to build
    a mental model of the type system. After years of writing type annotations in
    JSDoc comments for the Closure Compiler, this felt like typed JavaScript that
    really worked. And Microsoft had built a cross-platform text editor on top of
    Chromium? Perhaps this was a language and toolchain worth learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’d recently joined Sidewalk Labs and was writing our first JavaScript. The
    codebase was still small enough that Evan and I were able to convert it all to
    TypeScript over the next few days.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I’ve been hooked ever since. TypeScript is more than just a type system. It
    also brings a whole suite of language services which are fast and easy to use.
    The cumulative effect is that TypeScript doesn’t just make JavaScript development
    safer: it also makes it more fun!'

- en: Who This Book Is For
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *Effective* books are intended to be the “standard second book” on their
    topic. You’ll get the most out of *Effective TypeScript* if you have some previous
    practical experience working with JavaScript and TypeScript. My goal with this
    book is not to teach you TypeScript or JavaScript but to help you advance from
    a beginning or intermediate user to an expert. The items in this book do this
    by helping you build mental models of how TypeScript and its ecosystem work, making
    you aware of pitfalls and traps to avoid, and by guiding you toward using TypeScript’s
    many capabilities in the most effective ways possible. Whereas a reference book
    will explain the five ways that a language lets you do X, an *Effective* book
    will tell you which of those five to use and why.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: TypeScript has evolved rapidly over the past few years, but my hope is that
    it has stabilized enough that the content in this book will remain valid for years
    to come. This book focuses primarily on the language itself, rather than any frameworks
    or build tools. You won’t find any examples of how to use React or Angular with
    TypeScript, or how to configure TypeScript to work with webpack, Babel, or Rollup.
    The advice in this book should be relevant to all TypeScript users.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why I Wrote This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I first started working at Google, I was given a copy of the third edition
    of *Effective C++*. It was unlike any other programming book I’d read. It made
    no attempt to be accessible to beginners or to be a complete guide to the language.
    Rather than telling you what the different features of C++ did, it told you how
    you should and should not use them. It did so through dozens of short, specific
    items motivated by concrete examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The effect of reading all these examples while using the language daily was
    unmistakable. I’d used C++ before, but for the first time I felt comfortable with
    it and knew how to think about the choices it presented me. In later years I would
    have similar experiences reading *Effective Java* and *Effective JavaScript*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re already comfortable working in a few different programming languages,
    then diving straight into the odd corners of a new one can be an effective way
    to challenge your mental models and learn what makes it different. I’ve learned
    an enormous amount about TypeScript from writing this book. I hope you’ll have
    the same experience reading it!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How This Book Is Organized
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a collection of “items,” each of which is a short technical essay
    that gives you specific advice about some aspect of TypeScript. The items are
    grouped thematically into chapters, but feel free to jump around and read whichever
    ones look most interesting to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Each item’s title conveys the key takeaway. These are the things you should
    remember as you’re using TypeScript, so it’s worth skimming the table of contents
    to get them in your head. If you’re writing documentation, for example, and have
    a nagging sense that you shouldn’t be writing type information, then you’ll know
    to go read [Item 30: Don’t repeat type information in documentation](ch04.html#jsdoc-repeat).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The text of the item motivates the advice in the title and backs it up with
    concrete examples and technical arguments. Almost every point made in this book
    is demonstrated through example code. I tend to read technical books by looking
    at the examples and skimming the prose, and I assume you do something similar.
    I hope you’ll read the prose and explanations! But the main points should still
    come across if you skim the examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After reading the item, you should understand why it will help you use TypeScript
    more effectively. You’ll also know enough to understand if it doesn’t apply to
    your situation. Scott Meyers, the author of *Effective C++*, gives a memorable
    example of this. He met a team of engineers who wrote software that ran on missiles.
    They knew they could ignore his advice about preventing resource leaks, because
    their programs would always terminate when the missile hit the target and their
    hardware blew up. I’m not aware of any missiles with JavaScript runtimes, but
    the James Webb Space Telescope has one, so you never know!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, each item ends with “Things to Remember.” These are a few bullet points
    that summarize the item. If you’re skimming through, you can read these to get
    a sense for what the item is saying and whether you’d like to read more. You should
    still read the item! But the summary will do in a pinch.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All code samples are TypeScript except where it’s clear from context that they
    are JSON, GraphQL, or some other language. Much of the experience of using TypeScript
    involves interacting with your editor, which presents some challenges in print.
    I’ve adopted a few conventions to make this work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Most editors surface errors using squiggly underlines. To see the full error
    message, you hover over the underlined text. To indicate an error in a code sample,
    I put squiggles in a comment line under the place where the error occurs:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE0]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: I occasionally edit the error messages for clarity and brevity, but I never
    remove an error. If you copy/paste a code sample into your editor, you should
    get exactly the errors indicated, no more no less.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To draw attention to the lack of an error, I use `// OK`:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE1]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'You should be able to hover over a symbol in your editor to see what TypeScript
    considers its type. To indicate this in text, I use a comment starting with “type
    is”:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE

    result of a function call:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: This matches the type you’d see in your editor character for character. In the
    case of function calls you may need to assign to a temporary variable to see the
    type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'I will occasionally introduce no-op statements to indicate the type of a variable
    on a specific line of code:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE4]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The `x;` lines are only there to demonstrate the type in each branch of the
    conditional. You don’t need to (and shouldn’t) include statements like this in
    your own code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to be checked with the `--strict` flag. All samples were verified using TypeScript
    3.7.0-beta.
