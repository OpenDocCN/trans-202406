    map for your journey and gives you confidence to take the next steps with Kubernetes,
    whatever that looks like for you.

    quite possible that, if you’re reading this book, you are the current Kubernetes
    expert for your organization, at least for now. We hope you’ll continue to find
    this book useful as a source to refer back to often, but it’s also only just a
    starting point.

- en: A common observation about Kubernetes in the past few years is that it is becoming
    “boring,” and we think that is a very good thing. “Boring” in this context also
    means “reliable” and “predictable.” Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem
    around it have continued to mature and stabilize. This allows software organizations
    to make better plans around their future infrastructure investments, and hire
    engineers who have experience using these standard tools.

    real excitement should be focused around what we can go out and *do* with Kubernetes.
    The goal is to build excellent things that do good in the world and help solve
    problems for people.

    as widely as you can—and to learn as much as you can from others. None of us knows
    everything, but everybody knows something. Together, we just might figure things
    out.

    try things with it that you’re likely to need in production. If everything you
    do works perfectly, then you’re not experimenting enough. Real learning comes
    from failures, and from trying to figure out what’s wrong and fix them. The more
    you fail, the more you learn.
