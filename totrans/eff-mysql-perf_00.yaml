- en: 'A gap in MySQL literature exists between basic MySQL knowledge and advanced
    MySQL performance. There are several books about the former, and one book about
    the latter: *High Performance MySQL*, 4th Edition, by Silvia Botros and Jeremy
    Tinley (O’Reilly). This is the first book to bridge the gap.'

- en: The gap exists because MySQL is complex, and it’s difficult to teach performance
    without addressing that complexity—the proverbial elephant in the room. But engineers
    using (not managing) MySQL should not need to become MySQL experts to achieve
    remarkable MySQL performance. To bridge the gap, this book is unapologetically
    efficient—pay no attention to the elephant; it’s friendly.

- en: '*Efficient* MySQL performance means *focus*: learning and applying only the
    best practices and techniques that directly affect remarkable MySQL performance.
    Focus dramatically narrows the scope of MySQL complexity and allows me to show
    you a much simpler and faster path through the vast and complex field of MySQL
    performance. The journey begins with the first sentence of [Chapter 1](ch01.html#ch01),
    “Performance is query response time.” From there, we move fast through indexes,
    data, access patterns, and a lot more.'

- en: 'On a scale of one to five—where one is an introduction for anyone, and five
    is a deep dive for aspiring experts—this book ranges from three to four: deep,
    but far from the bottom. I presume that you’re an experienced engineer who has
    basic knowledge of and experience with a relational database (MySQL or otherwise),
    so I do not explain SQL or database fundamentals. I presume that you’re an accomplished
    programmer who is responsible for one or more applications that use MySQL, so
    I continually reference *the application* and trust that you know the details
    of *your application*. I also presume that you’re familiar with computers in general,
    so I talk freely about hardware, software, networks, and so forth.'

- en: Since this book focuses on MySQL performance for engineers using MySQL, not
    managing it, a few references to MySQL configuration are made when necessary but
    not explained. For help configuring MySQL, ask a DBA where you work. If you don’t
    have a DBA, hire a MySQL consultant—there are many great consultants with affordable
    contract options. You can also learn by reading the [*MySQL Reference Manual*](https://oreil.ly/Y1W2r).
    The MySQL manual is superb and experts use it all the time, so you’re in good
    company.
