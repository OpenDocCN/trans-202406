- en: In Part I, we’ve been talking about storage engines. We started from high-level
    database system architecture and classification, learned how to implement on-disk
    storage structures, and how they fit into the full picture with other components.

    structures do not represent an entire field, and there are many other interesting
    developments. However, these examples are still a good illustration of the three
    properties we identified at the beginning of this part: *buffering*, *immutability*,
    and *ordering*. These properties are useful for describing, memorizing, and expressing
    different aspects of the storage structures.'

    In in-place update structures like WiredTiger and LA-Trees, in-memory buffering
    helps to amortize the cost of multiple same-page writes by combining them. In
    other words, buffering helps to reduce write amplification.

- en: In immutable structures, such as multicomponent LSM Trees and FD-Trees, buffering
    has a similar positive effect, but at a cost of future rewrites when moving data
    from one immutable level to the other. In other words, using immutability may
    lead to deferred write amplification. At the same time, using immutability has
    a positive impact on concurrency and space amplification, since most of the discussed
    immutable structures use fully occupied pages.

- en: When using immutability, unless we *also* use buffering, we end up with unordered
    storage structures like Bitcask and WiscKey (with the exception of copy-on-write
    B-Trees, which copy, re-sort, and relocate their pages). WiscKey stores *only
    keys* in sorted LSM Trees and allows retrieving records in key order using the
    key index. In Bw-Trees, *some* of the nodes (ones that were consolidated) hold
    data records in key order, while the rest of the logical Bw-Tree nodes may have
    their delta updates scattered across different pages.

    structures. (1) WiscKey uses buffering only for keeping keys sorted order. (2)
    Only consolidated nodes in Bw-Trees hold ordered records.

    the desired characteristics. Unfortunately, storage engine design usually involves
    trade-offs: you increase the cost of one operation in favor of the other.'

    of most modern database systems. Some of the code references and starting points
    can be found across the entire book. Knowing and understanding the terminology
    will make this process easier for you.

    [[CORMODE04]](app01.html#CORMODE04), and there’s new research being done on bringing
    ideas from machine learning into database systems [[KRASKA18]](app01.html#KRASKA18).
    We’re about to experience further changes in research and industry as nonvolatile
    and byte-addressable storage becomes more prevalent and widely available [[VENKATARAMAN11]](app01.html#VENKATARAMAN11).

    and implement newer research, since it borrows from, builds upon, and is inspired
    by the same concepts. The major advantage of knowing the theory and history is
    that there’s nothing entirely new and, as the narrative of this book shows, progress
    is incremental.
