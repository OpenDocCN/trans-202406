- en: Welcome to *Hacking Kubernetes*, a book for Kubernetes practitioners who want
    to run their workloads securely and safely. At time of writing, Kubernetes has
    been around for some six years, give or take. There are over one hundred certified
    [Kubernetes offerings](https://oreil.ly/bo2xA) available, such as distributions
    and managed services. With an increasing number of organizations deciding to move
    their workloads to Kubernetes, we thought we’d share our experiences in this space,
    to help make your workloads more secure and safe to deploy and operate. Thank
    you for joining us on this journey, and we hope you have as much fun reading this
    book and applying what you learn as we had writing it.

    why we wrote the book, and explain how we think you should go about using it by
    providing a quick content guide. We will also go over some administrative details
    like Kubernetes versions and conventions used.

- en: To get most out of the book, we assume that you either have a DevOps role, are
    a Kubernetes platform person, a cloud native architect, a site reliability engineer
    (SRE), or something related to being a chief information security officer (CISO).
    We further assume that you’re interested in being hands-on—while we discuss threats
    and defenses in principle, we try our best to demonstrate them at the same time
    and point you to tools that can help you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point we also want to make sure you understand that the book you’re
    reading is targeting advanced topics. We assume that you’re already familiar with
    Kubernetes, and specifically Kubernetes security topics, at least on a surface
    level. In other words, we don’t go into much detail about how things work, but
    summarize or recap important concepts or mechanisms on a per-chapter basis.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Based on our combined 10+ years of hands-on experience designing, running, attacking,
    and defending Kubernetes-based workloads and clusters, we, the authors, want to
    equip you, the cloud native security practitioner, with what you need to be successful
    in your job.
  prefs: []

- en: Security is often illuminated by the light of past mistakes, and both of us
    have been learning (and making mistakes in!) Kubernetes security for a while now.
    We wanted to be sure that what we thought we understood about the subject was
    true, so we wrote a book to verify our suspicions through a shared lens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have both served in different companies and roles, given training sessions,
    published material from tooling to blog posts, and we have shared lessons learned
    on the topic in various public speaking engagements. Much of what motivates us
    here and the examples we use are rooted in our experiences in our day-to-day jobs
    and/or things we observed at our clients’ companies.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a threat-based guide to security in Kubernetes, using a vanilla
    Kubernetes installation with its (built-in) defaults as a starting point. We’ll
    kick off discussions with an abstract threat model of a distributed system running
    arbitrary workloads and progress to a detailed assessment of each component of
    a secure Kubernetes system.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In each chapter, we examine a component’s architecture and potential default
    settings and review high-profile attacks and historical Common Vulnerabilities
    and Exposures (CVEs). We also demonstrate attacks and share best-practice configuration
    in order to demonstrate hardening clusters from possible angles of attack.
