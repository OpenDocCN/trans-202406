      <h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>The Future of Cluster API <span class="keep-together">and Kubernetes</span></h1>
      <p>Cloud native architecture is not going away. To drive scale, the enterprise relies on modular, mircroservice-based applications. Automation and orchestration of complex deployments will only become more critical as time goes on. Containers and Kubernetes adoption will continue to accelerate, with more and more companies deploying multiple clusters that employ different Kubernetes distributions across a variety of environments.</p>
      <p>As use cases become more sophisticated and diverse, bare metal and edge deployments will become more important. The ecosystem must grow to meet these challenges, along with providers and tooling for new environments. Kubernetes itself is approaching maturity but will remain the nexus of an ecosystem of innovation, with continual development of integrations and supporting tools.</p>

        <h1>Experimental Features</h1>
        <p>Cluster API includes experimental features that provide a glimpse into what the future might hold. These features live in the <em>exp</em> directory and can be enabled by users who want to experiment.</p>
        <p>At the time of this writing, Cluster API provides the following experimental features:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt><code>ClusterClass</code> </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>An easier, more flexible way to create clusters</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><code>ClusterResourceSet</code> </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A way to apply a set of resources to a group of clusters</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Ignition bootstrap configuration </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A bootstrapping engine for bringing up workload nodes that use Ignition-based Linux operating systems</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><code>MachinePool</code> </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A feature similar to <code>MachineDeployment</code>, except that orchestration is handled by the infrastructure provider</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <h1>Ongoing Cluster API Development</h1>
        <p>Cluster API is open source and welcomes improvements by users, contributors, and maintainers. With these contributions, Cluster API will support a broader range of clouds, environments, and cluster types. The current road map is focused, among other things, on improving security, user experience, and provider support.</p>
        <p>Cluster API will continue to strengthen its position as the go-to orchestration tool for managing Kubernetes clusters with an increasing number of contributions and contributors, a growing set of infrastructure and platform providers supporting it, and more organizations using it. With Cluster API, people will increasingly be able to think of clusters the way they think of nodes now, moving entire applications from cluster to cluster whenever they need to. </p>
        <p>As big players and the open source community contribute to Cluster API, the capabilities for managing clusters and infrastructure declaratively will deepen and grow. </p>
