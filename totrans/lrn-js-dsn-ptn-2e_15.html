<p>That’s it for this introductory adventure into the world of design patterns in JavaScript and React. I hope you’ve found it beneficial.</p>

<p>Design patterns make it easy for us to build on the shoulders of developers who have defined solutions to challenging problems and architectures over several decades. The contents of this book should provide sufficient information to get you started using the patterns we covered in your scripts, plug-ins, and web applications.</p>

<p>We need to be aware of these patterns, but it’s also essential to know how and when to use them. Study the pros and cons of each pattern before employing them. Take the time to experiment with patterns to fully appreciate what they offer and make usage judgments based on a pattern’s actual value to your application.</p>

<p>If I’ve encouraged your interest in this area and you would like to learn more about design patterns, there are many excellent titles available for generic software development and, of course, JavaScript.</p>

<p>I am happy to recommend the following:<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="design patterns" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="further reading" id="idm45017683992528"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="patterns" data-secondary="about design patterns" data-tertiary="further reading" id="idm45017683991280"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Fowler, Martin" id="idm45017683990064"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Patterns of Enterprise Application (Fowler)" id="idm45017683989392"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Stefanov, Stoyan" id="idm45017683988752"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="JavaScript Patterns (Stefanov)" id="idm45017683988080"/></p>
