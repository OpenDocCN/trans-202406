- en: Microservices architecture is one of the hottest areas of application development
    today, particularly for cloud-based, enterprise-scale applications. The benefits
    of building applications using small, single-purpose services are well documented.
    But managing what can be enormous numbers of containerized services is no easy
    task and requires the addition of an “orchestrator” to keep it all together. Kubernetes
    is among the most popular and broadly used tools for this job, so it’s no surprise
    that the ability to use, troubleshoot, and monitor Kubernetes as an application
    developer is in high demand. To provide job seekers and employers a standard means
    to demonstrate and evaluate proficiency in developing with a Kubernetes environment,
    the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) developed the [Certified Kubernetes
    Application Developer (CKAD)](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/ckad/)
    program. To achieve this certification, you need to pass an exam.

- en: The CKAD is not to be confused with the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator
    (CKA)](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/cka/). While there is some topic
    overlap, the CKA focuses mostly on Kubernetes cluster administration tasks rather
    than developing applications operated in a cluster.

- en: In this study guide, I will explore the topics covered in the CKAD exam to fully
    prepare you to pass the certification exam. We’ll look at determining when and
    how you should apply the core concepts of Kubernetes to manage an application.
    We’ll also examine the `kubectl` command-line tool, a mainstay of the Kubernetes
    engineer. I will also offer tips to help you better prepare for the exam and share
    my personal experience with getting ready for all aspects of it.

- en: The CKAD is different from the typical multiple-choice format of other certifications.
    It’s completely performance based and requires you to demonstrate deep knowledge
    of the tasks at hand under immense time pressure. Are you ready to pass the test
    on the first go?
