<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>The JavaScript framework plays a significant role in modern web frontend development. When developing web projects, companies choose a framework for various reasons, including the quality of the final product, the cost of development, coding standard, and ease of development. Hence, learning to work with a JavaScript framework, such as Vue, is essential for any modern web developer (or frontend developer or full stack&#13;
developer).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is for programmers who want to learn and develop Web applications using Vue library, in JavaScript and TypeScript, from end to end. It focuses solely on how Vue and its ecosystem can help you build scalable and interactive web applications in the most straightforward and comfortable direction. While covering the basics, we will also get into Vue Router and Pinia for state management, testing, animation, deployment, and server-side rendering, making sure you are ready to move on and start developing complex Vue projects right away.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s OK if you are not familiar with Vue or the concept of Virtual DOM. This book doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of Vue or any similar framework. I will introduce and guide you through all Vue’s basics from scratch. I will also walk you through the Virtual DOM concept and reactivity system in Vue in Chapter 2, as the foundation for the rest of the book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book doesn’t require you to know TypeScript, though you will be better prepared if you are familiar with TypeScript basics. You will also be better prepared for the contents of the book if you have prior basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A solid foundation of these three is always crucial before diving to any web (or frontend) Javascript framework.</p>&#13;

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As I embarked on the journey of writing this book, my family was navigating a tumultuous period, full of highs and lows. Despite enjoying every moment, writing this book required a lot of time, effort, and dedication, and I wouldn’t be able to commit to it without the support from my family, particularly my husband, Natan. His encouragement, belief in my programming skills, humor about frontend development, parenting our children during my work travels, lending an ear to my daily grievances, and helping me balance work with personal life have been invaluable. Without Natan, I would not be where I am today.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Just as quality code demands thorough review, this book’s excellence owes much to critical technical insights and encouragement from Jakub Andrzejewski, Chris Fritz, Lipi Patnaik, Edward Wong, and Vishwesh Ravi Shrimali. Your valuable feedback has been pivotal in sharpening my focus and elevating the quality of this work.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>My heartfelt appreciation goes to my O’Reilly team: Zan McQuade and Amanda Quinn, for guiding me through the acquisition process of <em>Learning Vue</em>, and to my exceptional editor, Michele Cronin. Michele, your insightful feedback, professionalism, and empathy, particularly during the challenging final stages of the book, were extraordinary. The production editing skills of Ashley Stussy and the copyediting expertise of Beth Richards were crucial in elevating my manuscript to production quality. This book wouldn’t have materialized as envisioned without your collective efforts.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I extend a special thank you to the Vue core team for developing such a great framework and ecosystem, and to the Vue community members and friends for their support and inspiration. The knowledge and insights I gained from you are immeasurable and continue to enrich me daily.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Finally, my profound gratitude to you, the readers. Choosing this book from the plethora of resources available, including countless videos and tutorials, demonstrates a trust in my work that I deeply appreciate. I hope <em>Learning Vue</em> serves as a valuable tool in your journey, whether you aspire to be a web, frontend, or full-stack &#13;
<span class="keep-together">developer</span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. And remember, in the world of web development, always “react with a Vue.”</p>&#13;
