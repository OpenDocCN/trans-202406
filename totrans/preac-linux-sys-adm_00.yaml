- en: I love to teach. Some of my earliest memories are of teaching other kids to
    do something—play chess, paint, or build forts for action figures. I taught other
    students in high school and college. Teaching is something I do naturally. When
    I write articles, whitepapers, or books, I adopt the role of a teacher. I place
    the reader in a classroom and teach them tasks or concepts, such as changing permissions
    on a file or adding a new user to a system. This is how my mind works. This book,
    like almost everything I write, is a manifestation of that almost innate desire
    to teach, pass on some knowledge, and plant a seed of curiosity that grows, blossoms,
    and spreads to others. I hope you find inspiration in this book that leads you
    to do the same.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wrote this book to fill existing knowledge gaps for system administrators.
    I would have purchased this book for myself early in my career and kept it at
    my desk for reference. Sure, there’s plenty of technical information in the book,
    as you might expect, but there’s also career guidance and some coverage of the
    nontechnical aspects of being a system administrator.

- en: Being a Linux system administrator requires sacrifices from you and your family.
    I’ve often stated that a sysadmin’s whole family works for a company. This might
    be true for any job you have, but it seems especially relevant for system administrators.
    Linux system administration is a great career choice, but take time for yourself,
    your spouse, and your children. Remember that you don’t live to work; you work
    to live. You can’t get missed moments back—the milestones, events, and celebrations
    that create an existence that will be remembered fondly.
