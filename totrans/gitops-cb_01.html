<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>We wrote this book for builders. Whether you are a developer, DevOps engineer, site reliability engineer (SRE), or platform engineer dealing with Kubernetes, you are building some good stuff. We would like to share our experience from what we have learned in the field and in the community about the latest Kubernetes automation insights for pipelines and CI/CD workloads.
The book contains a comprehensive list of the most popular available software and tools in the Kubernetes and cloud native ecosystem for this purpose. We aim to provide a list of practical recipes that might help your daily job or are worth exploring further.
We are not sticking to a particular technology or project for implementing Kubernetes automation. However, we are opinionated on some of our choices to deliver a concise GitOps pathway.</p>
<p>The book is organized in sequential chapters, from the basics to advanced topics in the Kubernetes ecosystem, following the GitOps principles. We hope you’ll find these recipes valuable and inspiring for your projects!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#ch_intro">Chapter 1</a> is an introduction to GitOps principles and why they are continuously becoming more common and essential for any new IT project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#ch_Requirements">Chapter 2</a> covers the installation requirements to run these recipes in a Kubernetes cluster. Concepts and tools like Git, Container Registry, Container Runtime, and Kubernetes are necessary for this journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch03.xhtml#ch_Containers">Chapter 3</a> walks you through a complete overview of containers and why they are essential for application development and deployment today. Kubernetes is a container-orchestration platform; however, it doesn’t build containers out of the box. Therefore, we’ll provide a list of practical recipes for making container apps with the most popular tools available in the cloud native community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#ch_Kustomize">Chapter 4</a> gives you an overview of Kustomize, a popular tool for managing Kubernetes resources. Kustomize is interoperable, and you find it often used within CI/CD pipelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#ch_Helm">Chapter 5</a> explores Helm, a trendy tool to package applications in Kubernetes. Helm is also a templating system that you can use to deploy apps in CI/CD workloads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#ch_Cloud_Native_CICD">Chapter 6</a> walks you through cloud native CI/CD systems for Kubernetes. It gives a comprehensive list of recipes for the continuous integration part with Tekton, the Kubernetes-native CI/CD system. Additionally, it also covers other tools such as Drone and GitHub Actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch07.xhtml#ch_Argo_CD">Chapter 7</a> kicks off the pure GitOps part of the book as it sticks to the Continuous Deployment phase with Argo CD, a popular GitOps tool for Kubernetes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch08.xhtml#ch_Advanced_Topics">Chapter 8</a> goes into the advanced topics for GitOps with Argo CD, such as secrets management, progressive application delivery, and multicluster deployments. This concludes the most common use cases and architectures you will likely work with today and tomorrow following the GitOps approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
