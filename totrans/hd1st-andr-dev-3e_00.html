<p><strong>Dawn Griffiths</strong> started life as a mathematician at a top UK university, where she was awarded a first-class honors degree in mathematics. She went on to pursue a career in software development and has over 20 years’ experience working in the IT industry as a senior software developer.</p>
<p>When Dawn’s not working, you’ll find her honing her Tai Chi skills, reading, running, making bobbin lace, or cooking. She particularly enjoys spending time with her wonderful husband, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Griffiths</strong> began programming at age 12, when he saw a documentary on the work of Seymour Papert. At age 15, he wrote an implementation of Papert’s computer language LOGO. Since then, he has worked as an agile coach, a software developer, and a garage attendant, but not in that order.</p>
<p>When David’s not working, he spends much of his spare time traveling with his lovely wife, Dawn.</p>
<p>Together, Dawn and David have written a whole host of books, including Head First Android Development, <em>Head First Kotlin</em>, <em>Head First C</em>, <em>Head First Rails</em>, <em>Head First Statistics,</em> and the <em>React Cookbook</em>. They contributed to <em>97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know</em>, and they created the video course <em>The Agile Sketchpad</em> as a way of teaching key concepts and techniques in a way that keeps your brain active and engaged. They also deliver live, online training through the O’Reilly learning platform at <em><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/live-events">https://www.oreilly.com/live-events</a>.</em></p>
