- en: Software is integral to every industry today. From web and mobile apps that
    accelerate the digital transformation of business, to more efficient backend systems
    that support the growth of your business, to technology that’s embedded in devices
    as part of everyday life, containers have established themselves as a fundamental
    aspect of software delivery and operation across the spectrum.

- en: The operations and applications teams powering these transformations are seeing
    their application footprints grow tremendously in multiple locations, clouds,
    data centers, and out to the edge. The bigger the organization, the broader the
    footprint and the more complex the challenges. As cloud becomes an integral part
    of application deployment, organizations also wish to modernize their existing
    footprints and accelerate their development teams.

    which leads to an explosion of ecosystem benefits and approaches, which then leads
    to a need for new standardization. As one of the most successful open source ecosystems,
    Kubernetes has created a significant change in how we build and run applications.

- en: A key question that is probably on your mind is how to balance velocity and
    flexibility—scaling, integrating, and simplifying—while increasing your teams’
    ability to deliver value. Your organization may be heavily driven by your application
    teams, organically adopting new services in cloud footprints. In that case, you
    are likely focused on how to bring consistency of operational concerns to greenfield
    projects while minimizing disruption to teams.

    of compute, including devices at the edge, gateways and local application processing
    in data centers, visualization, and archival in the cloud. These true “hybrid”
    applications have unique needs at each location, but that location-specific behavior
    only strengthens the need to keep operational concerns aligned.

- en: Finally, your organization may run workloads similar to a large percentage of
    enterprise applications that are becoming truly cloud-agnostic. Thanks to modern
    application development frameworks, tools, and application infrastructure like
    Kubernetes, the underlying details of the infrastructure are less of a barrier
    to application portability and availability. For an organization aspiring to be
    cloud-agnostic, you are probably building a platform to consolidate and automate
    the life cycle of your business. The modern platforms to support hybrid cloud
    must address a number of serious challenges such as security, data consolidation,
    cost management, and increasing developer velocity to serve the applications that
    run your business.

    architect, I’ve spent the last seven years working to help large enterprises and
    small teams find that middle ground, as well as to ensure a consistent application
    environment across cloud, datacenter, and edge that enables customer platforms
    to succeed.

    The hockey stick of growth has taken us into broad adoption, and it’s the right
    time to take stock of the challenges, patterns, and technologies that can help
    bring that growth under control.

- en: This book dives deep on the problems and solutions that the most successful
    enterprise Kubernetes teams have encountered and gives you a trusted path to follow.
    The fusion of perspectives is key—from Brad’s work in the community driving consistency
    across open source projects and finding common ground for users, to Jake’s expertise
    in building and running cloud-scale Kubernetes with IBM Kubernetes Service and
    IBM Red Hat OpenShift Service, to Michael’s deep focus on helping organizations
    consolidate and secure multicluster Kubernetes as architect to Red Hat’s Advanced
    Cluster Management product.

    leverage Kubernetes effectively at scale in a way that can help organizations
    support their growing application fleet, whether it be cloud-first, multicloud,
    or connected to the edge.

- en: As we continue to standardize and simplify how applications are built and deployed
    across a wide range of environments, open source and open ecosystems help organizations
    collaborate towards shared goals. Kubernetes and other tools in our ecosystem
    are fundamental building blocks toward that end, and this book will help you navigate
    the trade-offs and opportunities along the way.
