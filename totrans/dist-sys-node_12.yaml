- en: HAProxy is a reverse proxy, useful for intercepting requests before they’re

- en: If you use Linux, you have a few options. The first option is to try to use
    your distro’s software installer to install `haproxy` directly. This might be
    as easy as **`sudo apt install haproxy`**. However, this may install a version
    of HAProxy that is too old. If the version of HAProxy that your distro provides
    is older than *v2*, which you can check by running **`haproxy -v`** after install,
    then you’ll need to install it another way.
