- en: When the web started, most websites consisted of a series of pages that users
    could navigate through by requesting and opening separate files. The location
    of the current file or resource was listed in the browser’s location bar. The
    browser’s forward and back buttons would work as expected. Bookmarking content
    deep within a website would allow users to save a reference to a specific file
    that could be reloaded at the user’s request. On a page-based, or server-rendered,
    website, the browser’s navigation and history features simply work as expected.

- en: In a single-page app, all of these features become problematic. Remember, in
    a single-page app, everything is happening on the same page. JavaScript is loading
    information and changing the UI. Features like browser history, bookmarks, and
    forward and back buttons will not work without a routing solution. *Routing* is
    the process of defining endpoints for your client’s requests.^([1](ch11.html#idm45901616941144))
    These endpoints work in conjunction with the browser’s location and history objects.
    They’re used to identify requested content so that JavaScript can load and render
    the appropriate user interface.

    Recognizing the importance of a routing solution, engineers Michael Jackson and
    Ryan Florence created one named simply React Router. The React Router has been
    adopted by the community as a popular routing solution for React apps.^([2](ch11.html#idm45901616937272))
    It’s used by companies including Uber, Zendesk, PayPal, and Vimeo.^([3](ch11.html#idm45901616936008))

    an SPA, a single-page application (see [Figure 11-1](#fig1101)).

    is used for regular React applications that use the DOM. If you’re writing an

    these packages at their experimental versions because React Router 6 is not officially

    Router. `Router` is used once and wraps all components that will use routing.
    All `Route` components need to be wrapped with a `Routes` component, which selects
    the component to render based on the window’s present location. `Link` components
    can be used to facilitate navigation. These basics can get you pretty far, but
