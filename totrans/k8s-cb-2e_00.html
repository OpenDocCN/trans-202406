<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Welcome to <em>Kubernetes Cookbook</em>, and thanks for choosing it! With this book, we want to help you solve concrete problems around Kubernetes. We’ve compiled more than 100 recipes covering topics such as setting up a cluster, managing containerized workloads using Kubernetes API objects, using storage primitives, configuring security, and plenty more. Whether you are new to Kubernetes or have been using it for a while, we hope you’ll find something useful here to improve your experience and use of Kubernetes.</p>&#13;

<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book was written for anyone who belongs somewhere in the DevOps spectrum. You might be an application developer who is required to occasionally interact with Kubernetes, or a platform engineer creating reusable solutions for other engineers in your organization, or anywhere in between. This book will help you navigate your way successfully through the Kubernetes jungle, from development to production. It covers core Kubernetes concepts as well as solutions from the broader ecosystem that have almost become de facto standards in the industry.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Collectively, we have been part of the Kubernetes community for many years and have seen the many issues beginners and even more advanced users run into. We wanted to share the knowledge we’ve gathered running Kubernetes in production, as well as developing on and in Kubernetes—​i.e., contributing to the core codebase or the ecosystem and writing applications that run on Kubernetes. It made perfect sense to work on the second edition of this book, considering that Kubernetes adoption has continued to grow in the years since the first edition of the book was published.</p>&#13;

<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This cookbook contains 15 chapters. Each chapter is composed of recipes written in the standard O’Reilly recipe format (Problem, Solution, Discussion). You can read this book from front to back or skip to a specific chapter or recipe. Each recipe is independent of the others, and when an understanding of concepts from other recipes is needed, appropriate references are provided. The index is also an extremely powerful resource because sometimes a recipe is also showcasing a specific command, and the index highlights these connections.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="A Note on Kubernetes Releases" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id325">&#13;
<h1>A Note on Kubernetes Releases</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://oreil.ly/3b2Ta">Kubernetes 1.27</a> was the latest stable version, released at the end of April 2023, and this is the version we’re using throughout the book as the baseline. However, the solutions presented here should, in general, work for older releases; we will call it out explicitly if this is not the case, mentioning the minimum required version.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Kubernetes follows a three-releases-per-year cadence. A release cycle has a length of approximately 15 weeks; for example, 1.26 was released in December 2022, 1.27 in April 2023, and 1.28 in August 2023, as this book was entering production. The Kubernetes <a href="https://oreil.ly/9eFLs">release versioning guidelines</a> indicate that you can expect support for a feature for the most recent three minor releases. Kubernetes Community supports active patch release series for a period of roughly 14 months. This means the stable API objects in the 1.27 release will be supported until at least June 2024. However, because the recipes in this book most often use only stable APIs, if you use a newer Kubernetes release, the recipes should still work.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Technology You Need to Understand" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id326">&#13;
<h1>Technology You Need to Understand</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This intermediate-level book requires a minimal understanding of a few development and system administration concepts. Before diving into the book, you might want to review the following:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>bash (Unix shell)</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>	 This is the default Unix shell on Linux and macOS. Familiarity with the Unix shell, such as for editing files, setting file permissions and user privileges, moving files around the filesystem, and doing some basic shell programming, will be beneficial. For a general introduction, consult books such as Cameron Newham’s <em><a class="orm:hideurl" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596009656.do ">Learning the bash Shell</a></em>, Third Edition, or Carl Albing and JP Vossen’s <em><a class="orm:hideurl" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920058304.do ">bash Cookbook</a></em>, Second Edition, both from O’Reilly.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Package management</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The tools in this book often have multiple dependencies that need to be met by installing some packages. Knowledge of the package management system on your machine is therefore required. It could be <em>apt</em> on Ubuntu/Debian systems, <em>yum</em> on CentOS/RHEL systems, or <em>Homebrew</em> on macOS. Whatever it is, make sure that you know how to install, upgrade, and remove packages.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Git</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Git has established itself as the standard for distributed version control. If you are not already familiar with Git, we recommend <em><a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/version-control-with/9781492091189/">Version Control with Git</a></em>, Third Edition, by Prem Kumar Ponuthorai and Jon Loeliger (O’Reilly) as a good place to start. Together with Git, the <a href="http://github.com">GitHub website</a> is a great resource to get started with a hosted repository of your own. To learn about GitHub, check out the <a href="http://training.github.com">GitHub Training Kit site</a>.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Go</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Kubernetes is written in Go. Go has established itself as a popular programming language more broadly in the Kubernetes community and beyond. This cookbook is not about Go programming, but it shows how to compile a few Go projects. Some minimal understanding of how to set up a Go workspace will be handy. If you want to know more, a good place to start is the O’Reilly video training course <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/introduction-to-go/9781491913871"><em>Introduction to Go Programming</em></a>.</p>&#13;
