&#13;
<p>Docker was first introduced to the <a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="history of development" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169545952"/><a data-primary="Hykes, Solomon" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169544704"/><a data-primary="dotCloud company" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169544032"/>world—with no pre-announcement and little fanfare—by Solomon Hykes, founder and CEO of a company then called dotCloud, in a five-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/wW9CAH9nSLs">lightning talk</a> at the <a href="https://us.pycon.org">Python Developers Conference</a> in Santa Clara, California, on March 15, 2013. At the time of this announcement, only about 40 people outside of dotCloud had been given the opportunity to play with Docker.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Within a few weeks of this announcement, there was a surprising amount of press. <a data-primary="GitHub" data-secondary="Docker source code" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169541104"/><a data-primary="resources online" data-secondary="Docker documentation" data-tertiary="source code on GitHub" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169540128"/>The source code was quickly released on <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby">GitHub</a> as a public and fully open source project. Over the next few months, more and more people in the industry started hearing about Docker and how it was going to revolutionize the way software was built, delivered, and run. And within a year, almost no one in the industry was unaware of Docker, but many were still unsure what it was exactly, and why people were so excited about it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Docker is a tool that promises to easily encapsulate the process of creating a distributable artifact for any application, deploying it at scale into any environment, and streamlining the workflow and responsiveness of Agile software organizations.</p>&#13;

<h1>The Promise of Docker</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Initially, many people who were unfamiliar<a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="ch01-about"/><a data-primary="continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)" data-secondary="workflow with Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="ch01-about2"/><a data-primary="CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery)" data-secondary="workflow with Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="ch01-about3"/> with Docker viewed it as some sort of virtualization platform, but in reality, it was the first widely accessible tool to build on top of a much newer technology called <em>containerization</em>. Docker and Linux containers have had a significant impact on a wide range of industry segments that include tools and technologies like Vagrant, KVM, OpenStack, Mesos, Capistrano, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and so on. There is something very telling about the list of products that have had their market share directly impacted by Docker, and maybe you’ve spotted it already. Looking over this list, most engineers would recognize that these tools span a lot of different use cases, yet all of these workflows have been forever changed by Docker. This is largely because Docker has significantly altered everyone’s expectations of how a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow should function. Instead of each step involving a time-consuming process managed by specialists, most people expect a<a data-primary="DevOps pipeline and Docker" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171468752"/> DevOps pipeline to be fully automated and flow from one step to the next without any human intervention. The technologies in that list are also generally acclaimed for their ability to improve productivity, and that’s exactly what has given Docker so much buzz. Docker sits right in the middle of some of the most enabling technologies of the last decade and can bring significant improvements to almost every step of the pipeline.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you were to do a feature-by-feature comparison of Docker and the reigning champion in any of these individual areas (e.g., configuration management), Docker would very likely look like a middling competitor. It’s stronger in some areas than others, but what Docker brings to the table is a feature set that crosses a broad range of workflow challenges. By combining the ease of application testing and deployment tools like Vagrant and Capistrano with the ease of administrating virtualization systems, and then providing interfaces that make workflow automation and orchestration easy to implement, Docker provides a very enabling feature set.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lots of new technologies come and go, and a dose of skepticism about the newest rage is always healthy. When Docker was a new technology, it would have been easy to dismiss Docker as just another technology that solves a few very specific problems for developers or operations teams. If you look at Docker as a pseudovirtualization or deployment technology alone, it might not seem very compelling. But Docker is much more than it seems on the surface.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It is hard and often expensive to get communication and processes right between teams of people, even in smaller organizations. Yet we live in a world where communicating detailed information between teams is increasingly required to be successful. Discovering and implementing a tool that reduces the complexity of that communication while aiding in the production of more robust software is a big win. And that’s exactly why Docker merits a deeper look. It’s no panacea, and the way that you implement Docker within your organization requires some critical thought, but Docker and Linux containers provide a good approach to solving some real-world organizational problems and helping enable companies to ship better software faster. Delivering a well-designed Linux container workflow can lead to happier technical teams and real savings for the organization’s bottom line.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So where are companies feeling the most pain? <a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="Linux containers" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171466000"/><a data-primary="Linux containers" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="about Docker" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171464480"/><a data-primary="containers" data-see="Linux containers" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171463264"/><a data-primary="Docker containers" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-see="Linux containers" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171462320"/>Shipping software at the speed expected in today’s world is hard to do well, and as companies grow from one or two developers to many teams of developers, the burden of communication around shipping new releases becomes much heavier and harder to manage. Developers have to understand a lot of complexity about the environment they will be shipping software into, and production operations teams need to increasingly understand the internals of the software they ship. These are all generally good skills to work on because they lead to a better understanding of the environment as a whole and therefore encourage the designing of robust software, but these same skills are very difficult to scale effectively as an organization’s growth accelerates.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The details of each company’s environment often require a lot of communication that doesn’t directly build value for the teams involved. For example, requiring developers to ask an operations team for release 1.2.1 of a particular library slows them down and provides no direct business value to the company. If developers could simply upgrade the version of the library they use, write their code, test with the new version, and ship it, the delivery time would be measurably shortened, and fewer risks would be involved in deploying the change. If operations engineers could upgrade software on the host system without having to coordinate with multiple teams of application developers, they could move faster. Docker helps to build a layer of isolation in software that reduces the burden of communication in the world of humans.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Beyond helping with communication issues, Docker is opinionated about software architecture in a way that encourages more robustly crafted applications. <a data-primary="Linux containers" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="atomic or throwaway" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171460176"/><a data-primary="atomic hosts" data-secondary="Linux containers as" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171458928"/><a data-primary="atomic hosts" data-secondary="Fedora CoreOS as" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171457984"/><a data-primary="Fedora CoreOS (Red Hat)" data-secondary="immutable atomic hosts" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169515456"/>Its architectural philosophy centers on atomic or throwaway containers. During deployment, the whole running environment of the old application is thrown away with it. Nothing in the environment of the application will live longer than the application itself, and that’s a simple idea with big repercussions. It means that applications are not likely to accidentally rely on artifacts left by a previous release. It means that ephemeral debugging changes are less likely to live on in future releases that picked them up from the local filesystem. And it means that applications are highly portable between servers because all of the state has to be included directly into the deployment artifact and be immutable, or sent to an external dependency like a database, cache, or file server.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>All of this leads to applications that are not only more scalable but more reliable as well. Instances of the application container can come and go with little impact on the uptime of the frontend site. These are proven architectural choices that have been successful for non-Docker applications, but the design choices enforced by Docker mean that containerized applications are <em>required</em> to follow these best practices. And that’s a very good thing.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Benefits of the Docker Workflow" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm46803169513456">&#13;
<h2>Benefits of the Docker Workflow</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s hard to cohesively categorize<a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="workflow with Linux containers" data-tertiary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="ch01-workflo"/><a data-primary="workflow with Docker" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="ch01-workflo2"/> all of the things Docker brings to the table. When implemented well, it benefits organizations, teams, developers, and operations engineers in a multitude of ways. It makes architectural decisions simpler because all applications essentially look the same on the outside from the hosting system’s perspective. It makes tooling easier to write and share between applications. Nothing in this world comes with benefits and no challenges, but Docker is surprisingly skewed toward the benefits. Here are some more of the benefits you get with Docker and Linux containers:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Packaging software in a way that leverages the skills developers already have</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Many companies have had to create positions for release and build engineers in order to manage all the knowledge and tooling required to create software packages for their supported platforms. Linux tools like <code>rpm</code>, <code>mock</code>, <code>dpkg</code>, and <code>pbuilder</code> can be complicated to use, and each one must be learned independently. <a data-primary="Open Container Initiative (OCI)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169504784"/>Docker wraps up all your requirements together into one packaging format, known as the <a href="https://opencontainers.org">Open Container Initiative (OCI)</a> standard.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Bundling application software and required OS filesystems together in a single &#13;
<span class="keep-together">standardized</span> image format</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>In the past, you typically needed to package not only your application but also many of the dependencies that it relied on, including libraries and daemons. However, you could never ensure that 100% of the execution environment was identical. For natively compiled code, this meant that your build system needed to have exactly the same shared library versions as your production environment. All of this made packaging difficult to master, and hard for many companies to accomplish reliably. <a data-primary="Linux" data-secondary="about containers and Linux versions" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169501248"/><a data-primary="Red Hat" data-secondary="Enterprise Linux" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169500256"/><a data-primary="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" data-secondary="download link" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169499312"/><a data-primary="Linux" data-secondary="distributions" data-see="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" data-tertiary="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803169498352"/>Often someone running <a href="https://scientificlinux.org">Scientific Linux</a> would resort to trying to deploy a community package tested on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>, hoping that the package was close enough to what they needed. With Docker, you deploy your application along with every single file required to run it. Docker’s layered images make this an efficient process that ensures that your application is running in the expected environment.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Using packaged artifacts to test and deliver the exact same artifact to all systems in &#13;
<span class="keep-together">all environments</span></dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>When developers commit changes to a version control system, a new Docker image can be built, which can go through the whole testing process and be deployed to production without having to be recompiled or repackaged at any step in the process, unless that is specifically desired.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Abstracting software applications from the hardware without sacrificing resources</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Traditional enterprise virtualization solutions like VMware are typically used when someone needs to create an abstraction layer between the physical hardware and the software applications that run on it, at the cost of resources. The hypervisors that manage the VMs and each VM’s running kernel use a percentage of the hardware system’s resources, which are then no longer available to the hosted applications. <a data-primary="Linux" data-secondary="kernel" data-tertiary="container as just another process" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171343264"/>A container, on the other hand, is just another process that typically talks directly to the underlying Linux kernel and therefore can utilize more resources, up until the system or quota-based limits are reached.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When Docker was first released, <a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="history of development" data-tertiary="Linux container accessibility" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171341312"/>Linux containers had been around for quite a few years, and many of the other technologies that Docker is built on are not entirely new. However, Docker’s unique mix of strong architectural and workflow choices combines into a whole that is much more powerful than the sum of its parts. Docker single-handedly made Linux containers, which have been publicly available since 2008, approachable and useful for all computer engineers. Docker fits containers relatively easily into the existing workflow and processes of real companies. And the problems discussed earlier have been felt by so many people that interest in the Docker project accelerated much faster than anyone could have reasonably expected.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>From a standing start in 2013, Docker has seen rapid iteration and now has a huge feature set and is deployed in a vast number of production infrastructures across the planet. It has become one of the foundation layers for any modern distributed system and has inspired many others to expand on the approach. A large number of companies now leverage Docker and Linux containers as a solution to some of the serious complexity issues that they face in their application delivery processes.<a data-startref="ch01-about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171339264"/><a data-startref="ch01-about2" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171338560"/><a data-startref="ch01-about3" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171337888"/><a data-startref="ch01-workflo" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171337216"/><a data-startref="ch01-workflo2" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171336544"/></p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="What Docker Isn’t" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="docker-is-not">&#13;
<h1>What Docker Isn’t</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Docker can be used to solve<a data-primary="Docker" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="capabilities not handled by" data-type="indexterm" id="ch01-tools"/> a wide range of challenges that other categories of tools have traditionally been enlisted to fix; however, Docker’s breadth of features often means that it lacks depth in specific functionality. For example, some organizations will find that they can completely remove their configuration management tool when they migrate to Docker, but the real power of Docker is that although it can replace some aspects of more traditional tools, it is also usually compatible with them or even enhanced in combination with them. In the following list, we explore some of the tool categories that Docker doesn’t directly replace but that can often be used in conjunction to achieve great results:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Enterprise virtualization platform (VMware, KVM, etc.)</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>A container is not a virtual machine in the traditional sense. Virtual machines contain a complete operating system, running on top of a hypervisor that is managed by the underlying host operating system. Hypervisors create virtual hardware layers that make it possible to run additional operating systems on top of a single physical computer system. This makes it very easy to run many virtual machines with radically different operating systems on a single host. With containers, both the host and the containers share the same kernel. This means that containers utilize fewer system resources but must be based on the same underlying operating system (e.g., Linux).</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Cloud platform (OpenStack, CloudStack, etc.)</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Like enterprise virtualization, the container workflow shares a lot of similarities—​on the surface—​with more traditional cloud platforms. Both are traditionally leveraged to allow applications to be horizontally scaled in response to changing demand. Docker, however, is not a cloud platform. It only handles deploying, running, and managing containers on preexisting Docker hosts. It doesn’t allow you to create new host systems (instances), object stores, block storage, and the many other resources that are often managed with a cloud platform. That being said, as you start to expand your Docker tooling, you should start to experience more and more of the benefits that one traditionally associates with the cloud.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Configuration management (Puppet, Chef, etc.)</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Although Docker can significantly improve an organization’s ability to manage applications and their dependencies, it does not directly replace more traditional configuration management.<a data-primary="Dockerfiles" data-primary-sortas="docker-a" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171570832"/> <em>Dockerfiles</em> are used to define how a container should look at build time, but they do not manage the container’s ongoing state and cannot be used to manage the Docker host system. Docker can, however, significantly lessen the need for complex configuration management code. As more and more servers simply become Docker hosts, the configuration management codebase that a company uses can become much smaller, and Docker can be used to ship the more complex application requirements inside of standardized OCI images.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Deployment framework (Capistrano, Fabric, etc.)</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Docker eases many aspects of deployment by creating container images that encapsulate all the dependencies of an application in a manner that can be deployed in all environments without changes. However, <a data-primary="deployment" data-secondary="Docker versus frameworks" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171567600"/>Docker can’t be used to automate a complex deployment process by itself. Other tools are usually still needed to stitch together the larger workflow. That being said, because Docker and other Linux container toolsets, like Kubernetes (k8s), provide a well-defined interface for deployment, the method required to deploy containers will be consistent on all hosts, and a single deployment workflow should suffice for most, if not all, of your Docker-based applications.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Development environment (Vagrant, etc.)</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Vagrant is a virtual machine management tool for developers that is often used to simulate server stacks that closely resemble the production environment in which an application will be deployed. Among other things, Vagrant makes it easy to run Linux software on macOS and Windows-based workstations. Virtual machines managed by tools like Vagrant assist developers in trying to avoid the common “it worked on my machine” scenario that occurs when the software runs fine for the developer but does not run properly elsewhere. However, as with many of the previous examples, when you start to fully utilize Docker, there is a lot less need to mimic a wide variety of production systems in development, since most production systems will simply be Linux container servers, which can easily be reproduced locally.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Workload management tool (Mesos, Kubernetes, Swarm, etc.)</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>An orchestration layer (including the built-in Swarm mode) must be used to coordinate work across a pool of Linux container hosts, track the current state of all the hosts and their resources, and keep an inventory of running containers. These systems are designed to automate the regular tasks that are needed to keep a production cluster healthy while also providing tools that help make the highly dynamic nature of containerized workloads easier for human beings to interact with.</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each of these sections point out an important function that Docker and Linux containers disrupted and improved. Linux containers provide a way to run software in a controlled and isolated environment, while the easy-to-use command line interface (CLI) tooling and container image standard that Docker introduced made working with containers much easier and ensured that there was a repeatable way to build software across the whole fleet.<a data-startref="ch01-tools" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171563536"/></p>&#13;

A single image can be copied to numerous hosts. <a data-primary="tags" data-secondary="image tags" data-seealso="image tags" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46803171408608"/>An image typically has a repository address, a name, and a tag. The tag is generally used to identify a particular release of an image (e.g., <em>docker.io/superorbital/wordchain:v1.0.1</em>). A Docker image is any image that is compatible with the Docker toolset, while an OCI image is specifically an image that meets the Open Container Initiative standard and is guaranteed to work with any OCI-compliant tool.</p>&#13;

<dt>Linux container</dt>&#13;

A specific container can exist only once; however, you can easily create multiple containers from the same image. The term <em>Docker container</em> is a misnomer since Docker simply leverages the operating system’s container functionality.</p>&#13;
