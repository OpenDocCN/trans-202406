<h1>Foreword to the First Edition</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Welcome to <em>Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes</em>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Kubernetes is a real industry revolution. Just a brief look at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io">Landscape</a>, which contains data about more than six hundred projects that exist in the cloud native world today, highlights the importance of Kubernetes these days. Not all these tools were developed for Kubernetes, not all of them can even be used with Kubernetes, but all of them are part of the huge ecosystem where Kubernetes is one of the flagship technologies.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Kubernetes changed the way applications are developed and operated. It’s a core component in the DevOps world today. Kubernetes brings flexibility to developers and freedom to operations. Today you can use Kubernetes on any major cloud provider, on bare-metal on-premises environments, as well as on a local developer’s machine. Stability, flexibility, a powerful API, open code, and an open developer community are a few reasons why Kubernetes became an industry standard, just as Linux is a standard in the world of operating systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes</em> is a great handbook for people who are performing their day-to-day activities with Kubernetes or are just starting their Kubernetes journey. John and Justin cover all the major aspects of deploying, configuring, and operating Kubernetes and the best practices for developing and running applications on it. They also give a great overview of the related technologies, including Prometheus, Helm, and continuous deployment. This is a must-read book for everyone in the DevOps world.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Kubernetes is not just yet another exciting tool; it is an industry standard and the foundation for next-generation technologies including serverless (OpenFaaS, Knative) and machine learning (Kubeflow) tools. The entire IT industry is changing because of the cloud native revolution, and it’s hugely exciting to be living through it.</p>&#13;
