<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>A gap in MySQL literature exists between basic MySQL knowledge and advanced MySQL performance.&#13;
There are several books about the former, and one book about the latter: <em>High Performance MySQL</em>, 4th Edition, by Silvia Botros and Jeremy Tinley (O’Reilly).&#13;
This is the first book to bridge the gap.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The gap exists because MySQL is complex, and it’s difficult to teach performance without addressing that complexity—the proverbial elephant in the room.&#13;
But engineers using (not managing) MySQL should not need to become MySQL experts to achieve remarkable MySQL performance.&#13;
To bridge the gap, this book is unapologetically efficient—pay no attention to the elephant; it’s friendly.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><em>Efficient</em> MySQL performance means <em>focus</em>: learning and applying only the best practices and techniques that directly affect remarkable MySQL performance.&#13;
Focus dramatically narrows the scope of MySQL complexity and allows me to show you a much simpler and faster path through the vast and complex field of MySQL performance.&#13;
The journey begins with the first sentence of <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, “Performance is query response time.”&#13;
From there, we move fast through indexes, data, access patterns, and a lot more.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>On a scale of one to five—where one is an introduction for anyone, and five is a deep dive for aspiring experts—this book ranges from three to four: deep, but far from the bottom.&#13;
I presume that you’re an experienced engineer who has basic knowledge of and experience with a relational database (MySQL or otherwise), so I do not explain SQL or database fundamentals.&#13;
I presume that you’re an accomplished programmer who is responsible for one or more applications that use MySQL, so I continually reference <em>the application</em> and trust that you know the details of <em>your application</em>.&#13;
I also presume that you’re familiar with computers in general, so I talk freely about hardware, software, networks, and so forth.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Since this book focuses on MySQL performance for engineers using MySQL, not managing it, a few references to MySQL configuration are made when necessary but not explained.&#13;
For help configuring MySQL, ask a DBA where you work.&#13;
If you don’t have a DBA, hire a MySQL consultant—there are many great consultants with affordable contract options.&#13;
You can also learn by reading the <a href="https://oreil.ly/Y1W2r"><em>MySQL Reference Manual</em></a>.&#13;
The MySQL manual is superb and experts use it all the time, so you’re in good company.</p>&#13;

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>&#13;
<!--PROD: Please reach out to author to find out if they will be uploading code examples to oreilly.com or their own site (e.g., GitHub). If there is no code download, delete this whole section. If there is, when you email digidist with the link, let them know what you filled in for title_title (should be as close to book title as possible, i.e., learning_python_2e). This info will determine where digidist loads the files.-->&#13;
