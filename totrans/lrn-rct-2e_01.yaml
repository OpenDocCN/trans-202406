    products faster. At the end of the day, isn’t that what we’re all here for? Not

- en: React was first created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It
    was incorporated into Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram when
    it was acquired by Facebook in 2012\. At JSConf 2013, React was made open source,
    and it joined the crowded category of UI libraries like jQuery, Angular, Dojo,
    Meteor, and others. At that time, React was described as “the V in MVC.” In other
    words, React components acted as the view layer or the user interface for your
    JavaScript applications.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'From there, community adoption started to spread. In January 2015, Netflix
    announced that they were using React to power their UI development. Later that
    month, React Native, a library for building mobile applications using React, was
    released. Facebook also released ReactVR, another tool that brought React to a
    broader range of rendering targets. In 2015 and 2016, a huge number of popular
    tools like React Router, Redux, and Mobx came on the scene to handle tasks like
    routing and state management. After all, React was billed as a library: concerned
    with implementing a specific set of features, not providing a tool for every use
    case.'

- en: Another huge event on the timeline was the release of React Fiber in 2017\.
    Fiber was a rewrite of React’s rendering algorithm that was sort of magical in
    its execution. It was a full rewrite of React’s internals that changed barely
    anything about the public API. It was a way of making React more modern and performant
    without affecting its users.

    React’s success is the strong team that has worked on the project over the years.

    constantly considering the impact any changes to the library will send cascading
    through the community.

    official [React blog](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog). When new versions
    of React are released, the core team will write a detailed blog post and changelog
    about what’s new. The blog has also been translated into an ever-expanding list
    of languages, so if English isn’t your native language, you can find localized
    versions of the docs on the [languages page](https://reactjs.org/languages) of
    the docs site.
