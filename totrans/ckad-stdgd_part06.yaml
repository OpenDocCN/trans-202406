- en: The last domain in the exam is named *Services and Networking*. It covers the
    Kubernetes primitives important for establishing and restricting communication
    between microservices running in the cluster, or outside consumers. More specifically,
    this domain covers the primitives Services and Ingresses, as well as network policies.

    will learn how to expose a microservice inside of the cluster to other portions
    of the system. Services also allows for making an application accessible to end
    users outside of the cluster. This chapter doesn’t stop there. It also provides
    techniques for troubleshooting misconfigured Service objects.'

    not good enough for exposing an application to outside consumers. The Ingress
    primitive can expose a load-balanced endpoint to consumers accessible via HTTP(S).'

    from a security perspective. By default, Kubernetes’ Pod-to-Pod communication
    is unrestricted; however, you want to implement the principle of least privilege
    to ensure that only those Pods can talk to other Pods required by your architectural
    needs. Limiting network communication between Pods will decrease the potential
    attack surface.'
