- en: The primary focus of the domain *Application Environment, Configuration, and
    Security* is configuring an application with security settings, defining and injecting
    configuration data, and specifying resource requirements. Two other aspects relevant
    to this domain are extending the Kubernetes API with custom resources, and the
    inner workings of processing requests to the Kubernetes API.

    your own primitives. You will learn how to define, inspect, and create a CustomResourceDefinition
    (CRD) as a schema for instantiating objects to implement custom requirements not
    natively covered by Kubernetes.'

    a call to the API server. More specifically, we’ll talk about the authentication
    phase and the authorization phase (including controlling permissions with RBAC).
    The chapter will also take you on a short excursion into the admission phase.'

    management relevant to application developers. You will learn about container
    resource requirements and their impact on Pod scheduling and runtime behavior.
    This chapter will also cover enforcing aggregate resource consumption of objects
    living in a specific namespace with the help of resource quotas. Finally, we’ll
    dive into governing resource consumption for specific resource types with limit
    ranges.'
