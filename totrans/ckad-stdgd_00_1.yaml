    covers all aspects of the exam curriculum, though basic knowledge of the Kubernetes
    architecture and its concepts is expected.

    Up and Running* by Brendan Burns, Joe Beda, Kelsey Hightower, and Lachlan Evenson

- en: The content of the book condenses the most important aspects of the CKAD exam.
    Given the plethora of configuration options available in Kubernetes, it’s impossible
    to cover all use cases and scenarios without duplicating the official documentation.
    Test takers are encouraged to reference the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home)
    as the go-to compendium for broader exposure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outline of the book follows the CKAD curriculum. While there might be a
    more natural, didactic structure for learning Kubernetes in general, the curriculum
    outline will help test takers prepare for the exam by focusing on specific topics.
    As a result, you will cross-reference other chapters of the book depending on
    your existing knowledge level. Be aware that this book covers only the concepts
    relevant to the CKAD exam. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation or other books
    if you want to dive deeper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practical experience with Kubernetes is key to passing the exam. Each chapter
    contains a section named “Sample Exercises” with practice questions. Solutions
    to those questions can be found in [Appendix A](app01_split_000.xhtml#appendix-a).

- en: The CNCF periodically updates all Kubernetes certifications to keep up with
    the latest developments in the field. In September 2021, the CKAD curriculum received
    a [major overhaul](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/ckad-program-change-2021/).
    The organization of existing topics has been changed, and new topics have been
    added, making the certification more relevant and applicable to Kubernetes practitioners
    in real-world scenarios.

    by the Deployment primitive. You will need to understand how to implement and
    manage blue/green deployments and canary deployments.

    Kubernetes applications by combining your configuration files into a single reusable
    package. You will need to understand how to use Helm for discovering and installing
    existing Helm charts.

    usage of APIs that are deprecated and removed. You will learn how to handle situations
    that require you to switch to a newer or replaced API version.

    types. You need to aware of how to create CRDs, as well as how to manage objects
    based on the CRD type.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every call to the Kubernetes API needs to be authenticated. As daily users of
    `kubectl`, application developers need to understand how to manage and use their
    credentials. Once authenticated, the request to the API also needs to pass the
    authorization phase. You need a rough understanding of role-based access control
    (RBAC), the concept that guards access to Kubernetes resources. Admission control
    is a topic covered by the CKA and Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)
    exams, and therefore I’ll just scratch the surface of this aspect.

    to outside consumers. The Ingress primitive routes HTTPS traffic to one of many
    Service backends. The Ingress is now part of the CKAD curriculum.

- en: Additionally, I included an “Exam Review Guide” in [Appendix B](app02.xhtml#appendix-b)
    that maps curriculum topics to the corresponding chapters in the book plus coverage
    of the topic in the Kubernetes documentation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The previous version of the CKAD curriculum included two topics that have been
    removed: “Create and configure basic Pods” and “Understand how to use Labels,
    Selectors, and Annotations.” This book covers both topics, even though they haven’t
    been mentioned explicitly. Pods are essential for running workload in Kubernetes,
    so you’ll definitely need to know about them. [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#pods_namespaces)
    explains the ins and outs. Given that labels and label selection are such important
    concepts to understand for primitives like the Deployment, Service, and Network
    Policies, I kept a dedicated chapter named [Labels and Annotations](ch09.xhtml#labels_annotations).'
