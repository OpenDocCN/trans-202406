<h1><span class="label">Chapter 1. </span>Foundations of Collaboration</h1>

<p>With the number of hours that we spend together working, it’s critical to build durable and long-lasting relationships with colleagues. This facilitates an understanding of the work an organization needs to do, and helps individuals plan for lifelong careers in the industry. The bedrocks of good, collaborative relationships are trust, empathy, and psychological safety. In this chapter, we briefly define each of these and explain how to foster them at work. We end with tips for how to promote effective, collaborative communication.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Empathy"><div class="sect1" id="empathy_idhkGi2J">
<h1>Empathy</h1>

<p><em>Empathy</em> is that ability that helps us understand how another person feels and imagine what they might be thinking, and improves our emotional connection with others. Here are the most common and effective methods for increasing empathy that can be applied in the workplace:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Listen</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Active listening—really concentrating on what someone is communicating, not just passively hearing what they’re saying or planning our response—builds our empathy and gives others room to express their message.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Ask questions</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Cultivating curiosity and asking questions can help us challenge our assumptions and biases. Example questions to ask yourself: <em>What context could I be missing from that decision? What unconscious biases might I have that are affecting my opinions on this?</em> Example questions to ask others: <em>What led you to choose X over Y? Could you tell me a bit more about your thought process on this?</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Appreciate individual differences</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>There are significant benefits to be gained from diverse teams in terms of creativity, problem solving, and productivity, though our differences can at times lead to short-term interpersonal conflicts. We can teach ourselves to appreciate these differences. Each of us has a different cultural background with unique experiences that inform our choices of how and why we work. Working with, genuinely listening to, and imagining ourselves as the various people that we work with can help us break down our biases, both conscious and unconscious.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Trust"><div class="sect1" id="trust_idjcRdOd">
<h1>Trust</h1>

<p><em>Trust</em> is the belief that those we depend on will meet the expectations we have of them. Building trust can increase the resiliency of a team and increase the likelihood that the team will accomplish its goals. Without trust, individuals can be protective of their projects or areas of responsibility, often to the detriment of their health or the team’s overall productivity. Here are a few things to keep in mind when building trust within teams:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Swift trust</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>In devops we sometimes need to practice trust with people with whom we don’t have a past working relationship. Swift trust, first explored by professor of organizational behavior Dr. Debra Meyerson,<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45727904050680-marker" href="ch01.xhtml#idm45727904050680">1</a></sup> occurs in short-term or short-lived teams in which trust is assumed from the beginning. A developer could join a new team with low trust and preconceived expectations of how operations generally works with development, or they could choose to adopt a default of trust and then verify its appropriateness based on the other team members’ behaviors and words. The latter is an example of swift trust.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Trust, but verify</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>In this approach, you start from a place of cautious trust, sharing responsibilities; then you strengthen that trust as you verify the behaviors and actions of the individual(s) with whom you’re working. This goes hand-in-hand with swift trust, and works best for short-lived teams because it is focused on desired outcomes rather than relationships. Someone who waits until trust has already been “earned” before granting access to resources or responsibilities (e.g., sharing commit access to a project they’ve been working on) might find themselves with a chicken-or-egg problem: how can someone earn trust if they’re not given opportunities to earn trust because they aren’t yet trusted?</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Self-disclosure</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Being open enough to share things about ourselves can encourage feelings of trust and intimacy between people and increase cooperative and collaborative attitudes. Be aware of the dangers inherent in power differentials between leadership and individual contributors. Guilting folks into sharing more than they are able or encouraging folks to trust or assume best intent without recognizing these differences can effectively derail the efforts being made. (You can read more about this in a thought-provoking article on <em>The Bias</em>.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45727910790392-marker" href="ch01.xhtml#idm45727910790392">2</a></sup>) There is a balance that we must achieve when practicing self-disclosure in the workplace: not enough disclosure can cause others to feel uncertain, but too much or inappropriate disclosure can damage trust and credibility. (Camille Fournier has written about problems that can affect trust,<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45727904049592-marker" href="ch01.xhtml#idm45727904049592">3</a></sup> and you can read about collaborative strategies and tools to nurture trust besides manager READMEs in a blog post by Lara Hogan.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45727904753208-marker" href="ch01.xhtml#idm45727904753208">4</a></sup>)</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Perception of fairness</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Employees need to trust that they are being treated fairly. When people understand the requirements of their role and the process for pay increases and promotions, they are less likely to feel unfairly overlooked. Developing formalized roles, job levels, and pay scales and providing reasonable transparency in these areas can go a long way toward improving employee satisfaction. Another key to a perception of fairness is sharing risk. If two teams are sharing work or resources but only one will be negatively affected if their project fails, the team with more risk might be distrustful of the team with less risk.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Psychological Safety"><div class="sect1" id="psychological_safety">
<h1>Psychological Safety</h1>

<p><em>Psychological safety</em> (a term coined and defined by Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson) is “a belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.”<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45727904047320-marker" href="ch01.xhtml#idm45727904047320">5</a></sup> It is the feeling that an environment or team is safe enough for people to open up and take risks. It is what allows people to show vulnerability, to admit that they don’t know something, to ask a question to which they might worry that they “should” know the answer, and to make mistakes and talk about those mistakes openly rather than trying to hide them.</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>A 2015 internal study at Google<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45727904041272-marker" href="ch01.xhtml#idm45727904041272">6</a></sup> analyzed more than 180 Google teams, trying to establish what makes teams more or less effective. The researchers determined that psychological safety is one of the five key foundations of a high-performing team—and the most important.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45727904042568-marker" href="ch01.xhtml#idm45727904042568">7</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>What does a team without psychological safety look like? People might spend hours struggling with a technical problem because they don’t feel comfortable asking for help, or might waste time solving the wrong problem because they didn’t understand a key point at a meeting and didn’t want to admit it. Here are a few tips for building psychological safety in your devops teams:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Encourage an “ask” culture</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Having achieved a secure position and social capital within your company, you have the privilege of asking questions. Even if you have all the answers, one of the greatest gifts you can give to new employees is to pretend that you don’t, and ask questions on topics that need clarification or are critical to understand. Model this asking in visible ways during group meetings or in Slack channels.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Find shared connections</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Look for ways to interact with your team members beyond work to find shared connections. This doesn’t need to be forced, as with icebreaker questions or team-building exercises. For distributed teams, getting regular video or voice time with colleagues or having a dedicated #chatter Slack channel to have general nonwork discussions can help.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Solicit feedback</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Ask people for feedback so that they know their opinions are valued. Providing explicit opportunities to share can help build an environment in which people view one another as collaborators, not competitors.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p>Things like shared coffee breaks, shared lunches long enough to both eat and talk, and opt-in activities for people with common interests can go a long way toward building strong communities. Pay extra attention to how you can do this for remote employees—distributed teams do require extra work to develop and maintain healthy communication practices. Tools such as Donut can be paired with Slack to facilitate remote pairing, and a variety of video chat tools can help remote teams get face-to-face time.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Communication"><div class="sect1" id="communication">
<h1>Communication</h1>

<p>Effective communication allows people to build shared understanding and find common goals, as opposed to working only in competition with one another. Aside from simply answering a question or telling somebody what to work on next, there are many different reasons why we communicate with one another—to increase understanding, assert influence, give recognition, and build community. Whatever the motivation, communication is an essential part of <span class="keep-together">collaboration.</span> Here are a few ways to improve communication and foster collaborative working relationships:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Incentivize collaborative communication</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Try publicly thanking people who bring an issue to someone’s attention. People want to be recognized for their work and their contributions, so recognition of good communication is important to sustaining those practices.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Be wary of an interrupting culture</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Pay attention in meetings, and count how often people interrupt one another. Frequent interruptions require that time be spent repeating things that were said while someone else was talking, and can cause people to speak loudly simply to be heard. An interrupting culture tends toward competitive, rather than collaborative, communication. Cutting down on interrupting not only increases understanding, but also helps people feel that they are being heard, increasing trust and empathy.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Leaders can wait to speak</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>Senior engineers or leaders within the organization can practice waiting for others to speak before sharing their own opinions. People won’t always feel comfortable voicing disagreement to someone with more organizational clout than them. This is especially true of people newer to an organization, whose fresh eyes often bring a new perspective and valuable insights.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Practice communicating as “remote by default”</dt>
	<dd>
	<p>This means using remote-friendly methods of communication like email and group chat for as much communication as possible and as the first choice of method, not a last resort. If an employee posts a question in the team’s chat room instead of walking over to a colleague’s desk, employees on distributed teams can learn and participate in discussions that they wouldn’t otherwise be part of.</p>
	</dd>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>A foundation of trust, empathy, and psychological safety is required to establish a collaborative culture and foster devops within your organization. People in environments that are higher-trust and more supportive overall tend to be better at communicating effectively. An organization in which people actively look for ways to support and help one another throughout the software and product development life cycles is an organization built on collaboration. Without team psychological safety, people won’t take the risk of asking the questions critical to clarifying goals and objectives. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#collaboration_in_practice">Chapter 2</a>, we look at practical ways to apply collaboration principles in the software development life cycle.</p>
