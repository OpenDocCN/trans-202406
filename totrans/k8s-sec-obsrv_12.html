<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>We hope that the book helped you understand how observability and security for Kubernetes deployments are different from traditional deployments. And we hope that the book is a guide for you as you design and implement your security and observability strategy, whether you are in the early stages of your journey or further along in adopting Kubernetes. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="security at every stage" data-seealso="security" id="idm45326824711392"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="observability and" data-tertiary="at every stage" id="idm45326824709744"/>The key takeaway is that you need to think about security and observability at every stage of your journey; it should not be an afterthought that is implemented once you have designed your deployment. We often hear folks say, “I will not need to worry about security or observability for a while; let me first get my workloads running in Kubernetes.” This line of thinking is not right, as the right security implementation will likely alter the design and will likely cause an untimely iteration to the design and delay the implementation. The following are some of the characteristics that make Kubernetes different:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Kubernetes is the most widely adopted orchestration engine for deploying modern applications and is used both in public cloud and on-premise <span class="keep-together">deployments.</span></p></li>
<li><p>Kubernetes is declarative in nature and <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="declarative nature" id="idm45326824704880"/>enables users to specify outcomes for their application deployments (e.g., scale, specifications, access, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>Kubernetes continuously monitors the status of the deployment and takes corrective action to ensure the deployment is operating as specified.</p></li>
<li><p>Kubernetes abstracts the details of networking,<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Kubernetes" data-secondary="about networking" id="idm45326824701936"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="network policies" data-secondary="about Kubernetes networking" id="idm45326824700560"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="networking" data-secondary="about Kubernetes" id="idm45326824699216"/> IP addresses, etc., and instead allows users to define identity using higher-level constructs like labels.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to these characteristics, implementing observability and security for Kubernetes needs a different approach.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These characteristics of Kubernetes have also altered the development process<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="teams" data-secondary="Kubernetes and development process" id="idm45326824696528"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="development teams" id="idm45326824695248"/> and the teams involved. Previously, development teams built applications that would be deployed on preprovisioned infrastructure. In today’s world, when you deploy an application in the cloud, you first provision the infrastructure (e.g., hosts, VMs, etc.) that is required for your application and then deploy your application on the provisioned infrastructure. Also, the infrastructure is dynamic and adapts to the needs of the application. <a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="application life cycle" id="idm45326824693584"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deploying a workload" data-secondary="life cycle of an application" id="idm45326824692480"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="workloads" data-secondary="deploying" data-tertiary="life cycle of an application" id="idm45326824691136"/>The following lists the life cycle of an application in a Kubernetes cluster and the role of various teams:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The deployment of an application comprises the build stage<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="build stage of deployment" id="idm45326824688272"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="deploying a workload" data-secondary="about deployment stage" id="idm45326824686976"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="runtime security" data-secondary="about runtime stage of deployment" id="idm45326824685600"/> (create the resources needed for the application), the deploy stage (deploy the application using Kubernetes), and the runtime stage (application operation post deployment).</p></li>
<li><p>The teams that are responsible for successful deployment and<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="teams" data-secondary="about" id="idm45326824683344"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="operations teams" id="idm45326824681888"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="DevOps" id="idm45326824680784"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="platform teams" id="idm45326824679680"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="networking" data-secondary="networking teams" id="idm45326824678576"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="security teams" data-tertiary="about" id="idm45326824677200"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compliance" data-secondary="compliance teams" id="idm45326824675552"/> operation of the application are the operations team, the platform team, the networking team, the security team, and the compliance team.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to design an effective security and observability strategy for your application, you need to consider security and observability at all stages.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration between the teams is critical to success as security is a joint responsibility of all the teams involved.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following checklist is a good guide to ensure that you have an<a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="observability" data-secondary="checklist" id="idm45326824671984"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="security" data-secondary="checklist" id="idm45326824670528"/><a contenteditable="false" data-type="indexterm" data-primary="checklist for security and observability" id="idm45326824669152"/> effective security and observability implementation for your Kubernetes deployments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All images are scanned for known vulnerabilities prior to deployment and then periodically scanned for vulnerabilities discovered post-deployment.</p></li>
<li><p>All container images being deployed are built with minimal base OS components (e.g., distroless or scratch images).</p></li>
<li><p>The operating system on the host is an immutable Linux distribution that reduces the attack surface area.</p></li>
<li><p>The host OS and the pods deployed are configured with controls that only allow required access (e.g., system calls, filesystem access).</p></li>
<li><p>The Kubernetes cluster deployment is hardened with the encryption of secrets, securing access to the API server and the data store.</p></li>
<li><p>Deployment of workloads in your Kubernetes cluster is controlled by best practices for RBAC and admission controllers to enforce policies.</p></li>
<li><p>All access to services in your cluster is exposed to external clients using security best practices.</p></li>
<li><p>The Kubernetes cluster has an integration with a perimeter security device (firewall or a gateway) to enable the device to have visibility into traffic originating from the cluster so it can add effective controls.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to ensure that access control is in place for network traffic and application traffic using L3/L7 policies.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that you are using a tool native to Kubernetes to implement observability; e.g., your tool needs to be aware that pods backing a service or a deployment are identical and should be viewed as a unit to “observe” a service.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that you implement machine learning to baseline behavior of various entities in your cluster and build an anomaly detection system layered above that to detect security incidents.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that you implement threat defense features like IDS, IPS, and advanced threat detection techniques in your cluster to detect malicious activity inside your cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that you have implemented data in transit encryption for communication inside the cluster as well as communication to external entities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We wish you the best in your Kubernetes journey as you implement security and observability for your workloads!</p>
