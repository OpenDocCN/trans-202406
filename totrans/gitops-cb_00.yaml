- en: A few years ago, during a trip to Milan for a Red Hat event, I ran into a passionate
    colleague at the Red Hat office. We spoke at length about how customers in Italy
    adopt containers to speed up application development on OpenShift. While his name
    slipped my mind at the time, his enthusiasm about the subject didn’t, especially
    since he was also hospitable enough to take me to an espresso bar near the office
    to show me what real coffee tastes like. A while later, I was introduced to a
    developer advocate in a meeting who would speak at a conference about CI/CD using
    products like OpenShift Pipelines and OpenShift GitOps that my teams delivered
    at the time. At that moment, I instantly recognized Natale. Many who attended
    that talk thought it was insightful, given his firsthand grasp of challenges that
    customers experience when delivering applications and his hands-on approach to
    technology.

  zh: 几年前，在为红帽公司的一次米兰活动旅行期间，我在红帽办公室遇到了一位热情的同事。我们就意大利客户如何在 OpenShift 上采用容器加快应用程序开发的话题进行了深入交流。虽然当时我忘记了他的名字，但他对这个主题的热情印象深刻，特别是因为他还热情地带我去办公室附近的一家浓缩咖啡吧，让我体验真正的意式咖啡味道。不久后，在一次会议上，我认识了一位开发者倡导者，他将在会议上讲述如何使用我们团队当时提供的
    OpenShift Pipelines 和 OpenShift GitOps 等产品进行 CI/CD。那一刻，我立刻认出了 Natale。出席那次讲座的许多人认为这是一次富有洞察力的演讲，因为他对客户在交付应用程序时遇到的挑战有第一手的理解，以及他对技术的实际应用。
- en: Application delivery is a complex process involving many systems and teams with
    numerous handoffs between these parties, often synonymous with delays and back-and-forth
    talks at each point. Automation has long been a key enabler for improving this
    process and has become particularly popular within the DevOps movement. Continuous
    integration, infrastructure as code, and numerous other practices became common
    in many organizations as they navigated their journey toward adopting DevOps.

  zh: 应用程序交付是一个复杂的过程，涉及许多系统和团队之间的多次交接，往往伴随着每个环节的延迟和反复沟通。自动化长期以来一直是改善这一过程的关键推动因素，并且在
    DevOps 运动中变得尤为流行。持续集成、基础设施即代码和许多其他实践在许多组织中变得普遍，因为它们在采纳 DevOps 过程中航行。
- en: More recently, and coinciding with the increased adoption of Kubernetes, GitOps
    as a blueprint for implementing a subset of DevOps practices has become an area
    I frequently get asked about. While neither the term nor the practices GitOps
    advocates are new, it does combine. It presents the existing knowledge in a workflow
    that is simple, easy to understand, and can be implemented in a standard way across
    many teams.

  zh: 近年来，随着 Kubernetes 的广泛采用增加，GitOps 作为实施 DevOps 实践子集的蓝图已成为经常被问及的领域。虽然 GitOps 倡导的术语和实践并不新鲜，但它结合了现有的知识，以一种简单易懂的工作流呈现，并可以在许多团队中以标准方式实施。
- en: Although the path to adopting the GitOps workflow is simple and concrete, many
    technical choices need to be made to fit within each organization’s security,
    compliance, operational, and other requirements. Therefore, I am particularly
    thrilled about the existence of this book and the practical guides it provides
    to assist these teams in making choices that are right for their applications,
    teams, and organizations.

  zh: 尽管采用 GitOps 工作流的路径简单而具体，但需要在符合每个组织的安全、合规性、运营和其他需求的技术选择中作出许多决策。因此，我特别高兴看到这本书的存在以及它提供的实用指南，帮助这些团队为他们的应用程序、团队和组织做出合适的选择。
