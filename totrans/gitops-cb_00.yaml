- en: A few years ago, during a trip to Milan for a Red Hat event, I ran into a passionate
    colleague at the Red Hat office. We spoke at length about how customers in Italy
    adopt containers to speed up application development on OpenShift. While his name
    slipped my mind at the time, his enthusiasm about the subject didn’t, especially
    since he was also hospitable enough to take me to an espresso bar near the office
    to show me what real coffee tastes like. A while later, I was introduced to a
    developer advocate in a meeting who would speak at a conference about CI/CD using
    products like OpenShift Pipelines and OpenShift GitOps that my teams delivered
    at the time. At that moment, I instantly recognized Natale. Many who attended
    that talk thought it was insightful, given his firsthand grasp of challenges that
    customers experience when delivering applications and his hands-on approach to
    technology.

    numerous handoffs between these parties, often synonymous with delays and back-and-forth
    talks at each point. Automation has long been a key enabler for improving this
    process and has become particularly popular within the DevOps movement. Continuous
    integration, infrastructure as code, and numerous other practices became common
    in many organizations as they navigated their journey toward adopting DevOps.

    as a blueprint for implementing a subset of DevOps practices has become an area
    I frequently get asked about. While neither the term nor the practices GitOps
    advocates are new, it does combine. It presents the existing knowledge in a workflow
    that is simple, easy to understand, and can be implemented in a standard way across
    many teams.

    technical choices need to be made to fit within each organization’s security,
    compliance, operational, and other requirements. Therefore, I am particularly
    thrilled about the existence of this book and the practical guides it provides
    to assist these teams in making choices that are right for their applications,
    teams, and organizations.
