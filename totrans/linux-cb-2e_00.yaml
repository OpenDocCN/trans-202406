- en: Way back in olden times I wrote the first edition of the *Linux Cookbook*, which
    was released unto a joyous world in 2004\. It sold well, I heard from many happy
    readers, and some are still my friends.

- en: For a Linux book, 17 years old is ancient. Linux was 14 years old in 2004, a
    wee baby computer operating system. Even so, it was already a popular and widely
    used powerhouse, adapting to any role, from tiny embedded devices to mainframes
    and supercomputers. The rapid growth of Linux is partly due to it being a free
    clone of Unix, the most mature and powerful operating system of all. The other
    major factor in the speedy growth and adoption of Linux is the absence of barriers.
    Anyone can download and try it, and the source code is freely available to anyone
    who wants to use and contribute to it.

- en: At the time it was a great example of form following function, like my first
    car. It ran, it was reliable, but it wasn’t pretty, and it needed a lot of custom
    wiggling of this and jiggling of that to keep going. Running a Linux system back
    then meant learning your way around a hodgepodge of commands, scripts, and configuration
    files, and a fair bit of wiggling and jiggling. Software management, storage management,
    networking, audio, video, kernel management, process management…everything required
    a lot of hands-on work and continual study.

- en: Some 17 years later, every important subsystem in Linux has substantially changed
    and improved. Now all those manual chores we had to do for basic administration
    are replaced by what I call “It Just Works Subsystems.” Every aspect of running
    a Linux system is many times easier, and we can focus on using Linux to do cool
    things instead of having to wiggle and jiggle this and that just to keep it running.

    and I hope you enjoy learning about all of this cool new goodness.

- en: Who Should Read This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for people with some computer experience, though not necessarily
    Linux experience. I’ve done my best to make it as accessible as possible for Linux
    beginners. You should understand some basic networking concepts, such as IP addressing,
    Ethernet, WiFi, client, and server. You should know basic computer hardware and
    have some understanding of using the command line. If you need some help with
    these, there are abundant resources for learning them; I did not want to get bogged
    down in teaching material that is already well documented.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The recipes in this book are hands-on. My goal is for the reader to be successful
    on the first try, though don’t feel badly if you are not. A general-purpose Linux
    computer is an extremely complex machine, and there is a lot to learn. Be patient,
    take your time, and read more than you want to. Chances are the answers you want
    are just a few sentences away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every Linux has built-in documentation for commands called *man pages* (short
    for “manual pages”). For example, *man 1 ls* documents the *ls*, or list directory
    contents, command. Type these commands exactly as shown in the book to open the
    correct man page. You can also find this information online.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have long wanted to write a book like this, that collects what I think are
    the most necessary Linux skills in one book. Linux is everywhere, and no matter
    where you find it, Linux is Linux, and the needed skills are the same. The tech
    world moves fast, and I think you will find this book provides a solid foundation
    that you can build on, no matter what direction your interests take you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The cookbook format is especially good for teaching fundamentals because it
    shows how to solve specific real-world problems and separates the wordy explanations
    from the steps needed to accomplish a task.
