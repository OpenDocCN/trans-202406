<h1>Comparing Native Development to Cross-Platform Tools</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s<a data-primary="environment setup" data-secondary="native versus cross-platform tools" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214800552"/><a data-primary="native mobile development" data-secondary="native versus cross-platform tools" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214799576"/> state some facts and draw some initial conclusions to be clear.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When we say “native development,” we mean programming for each platform in the language, framework, and IDE supported and promoted by the maintainers of the platform. The platforms are Android and iOS.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For Android, the maintainer is Google. We say “maintainer” rather than “owner” because it is really open source—in fact, Amazon’s FireOS is a fork of the Android OS. Sometimes, we refer to the<a data-primary="Android Open Source Project (AOSP)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214797320"/> Android Open Source Project with the acronym AOSP. The language is Java, Kotlin, or a mix (Kotlin generates Java bytecode; as far as the runtime is concerned, there’s no difference). You could technically create an Android app in any language that produced Java byte code—in fact, one of our friends once wrote an Android app completely in Scala. That said, we’re only using Java and Kotlin in this book. The framework doesn’t have a specific name and is generally just referred to as “the Android framework.”</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When<a data-primary="native mobile development" data-secondary="definition of native" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214795368"/> we say “native development,” we do <em>not</em> mean native in the context you might see <em>within</em> a framework, which would indicate either the system-provided functionality like the system clock (surprisingly important), thread, or filesystem implementations, etc. We also do not mean “native” in the sense of the<a data-primary="Android Native Development Kit (Android NDK)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214793096"/> Android Native Development Kit (aka Android NDK), which allows you to invoke code written in C or C++ from within an <code>Activity</code> or <code>Service</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So with that established, let’s compare some<a data-primary="cross-platform experience" data-secondary="cross-platform tools" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214790888"/> cross-platform tools. There are many different products available for cross-platform development, but really only a few approaches.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Web-Based" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm46177214789544">&#13;
<h2>Web-Based</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Products<a data-primary="PhoneGap" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214788248"/><a data-primary="single codebase" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214787512"/> like PhoneGap allow a developer to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that are rendered using web-based view components in each platform. We have found that while this is certainly simpler in the sense that there is only a single codebase (in theory) and these technologies and languages are well-known and well-supported, the reality is that very seldom can you actually get away with a single codebase—the idiosyncrasies of each platform often require a lot of conditional logic for each branch. It can also be difficult to keep up with updates or additions to each native development framework.</p>&#13;

<h2>Other</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are a number of other products that aim to simplify cross-platform development. Google has a tool called <a data-primary="Flutter" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214784392"/><a data-primary="Dart language" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214783688"/>Flutter, which uses the Dart language and its own kernel to create both Android and iOS apps from the same codebase and, since it’s not relying on existing frameworks, is able to run apps at double the standard framerate, from 60 to 120 frames per second. On devices powerful enough to support this, scrolling can feel almost <em>physical</em>—as if you were actually dragging a piece of paper along a smooth surface. The downside of Flutter is that it’s almost impossible to really have a single uniform codebase for both platforms—Android users expect different widgets, reactions to input, transitions, etc., than iOS users, and vice versa. Similarly, by not taking advantage of the Android or Cocoa installations already on the device, the size a Flutter app requires is almost always going to be markedly larger than a natively developed app.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Another<a data-primary="React Native" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214781208"/> approach—this one pioneered by Facebook—is React Native. React Native uses Facebook’s proprietary flavor of JavaScript to create apps in both platforms from a single codebase. Besides some of the drawbacks mentioned earlier, you’re ceding a large portion of control of your app to an entirely unrelated third party (Facebook). If Facebook wants to start grabbing metrics completely transparently to you as the developer, there’s not much you could do about it. I’m in no way suggesting it does, or ever will, do something like this; it’s simply a heavy-handed example of one of the costs associated with cross-platform tools that might not be immediately available.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are other tools, and we as the authors don’t want to waste our time or your criticizing some really amazing work done by others to fill this gap. We just want you to understand why we genuinely believe that side-by-side development in each platform—using each platform’s language and framework and toolsets, etc., can not only provide tremendous benefit, but also does not in our opinion double the cost or time or even investment of attention. As we’ve tried to show throughout this book, there really is a lot of similarity between the two platforms, and writing a single application for each platform using native tools doesn’t have to be as onerous a task as you might think.</p>&#13;

<h1>Environment Setup</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In order to work with Android and iOS, we first need to get our environments set up. Thankfully, nothing prevents both Android Studio and Xcode from being installed on a single machine. Android Studio can be installed on a number of platforms, but because we’re using Xcode, Apple’s IDE for iOS development, we’ll need to use a machine capable of running macOS for Xcode. Let’s get set up for Android development first.</p>&#13;

&#13;

This is supported and recommended by Google, the Android maintainer. Technically, it’s certainly possible to do it without Android Studio, but that’s a fairly advanced topic and should probably be used only in very specific scenarios, but we have seen it done (it was messy). For now, let’s assume you’re going to go along, and start with Android Studio.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s see how to get rolling. For Android, installation runs directly into new project creation, so we’ll roll the whole process into a single set of instructions.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Set up Android Studio" data-type="sect3"><div class="sect3" id="idm46177214770312">&#13;
<h3>Set up Android Studio</h3>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At one time, setting up an Android environment was pretty complicated and involved multiple moving parts. With the advent <em>and maturity</em> of Android Studio (the recommended IDE for Android development), it’s become almost trivial. It even comes with an embedded<a data-primary="Java Development Kit (JDK)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214767560"/> JDK (Java Development Kit), so it’s really just one download and initial setup.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At the time of this writing, Android Studio could be<a data-primary="Android Studio" data-secondary="setup" data-tertiary="downloading" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214766376"/> downloaded at <em><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio"><em class="hyperlink">https://developer.android.com/studio</em></a></em>, but feel free to just search the web for “Download Android Studio” if you’re a reader in some far-flung future where URLs have been replaced by robots.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once Android Studio is downloaded, launch it! We’ll lay out the sequence between download and first run as it happened at the time of this writing, summer 2019. This sequence may change in the future, but presumably the basic premise will remain the same and generally speaking will provide options that won’t directly affect development. Use your best judgment if what you see on your screen deviates from this walk-through.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The<a data-primary="Android Studio" data-secondary="setup" data-tertiary="import settings screen" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214762216"/> program may ask you to import settings from a previous installation; if this is your first time installing, skip the import step and continue to <a data-type="xref" href="#figures_android_setup_import_settings">Figure 15-1</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figures_android_setup_import_settings">&#13;
<img alt="Import Settings Screen" src="assets/nmdv_1501.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 15-1. </span>Import settings screen</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Android Studio should start the initialization process now. Watch the loading bar for progress. When that’s complete, you may see a<a data-primary="Android Studio" data-secondary="setup" data-tertiary="welcome screen" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214757240"/> welcome screen, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#figures_android_setup_welcome_screen">Figure 15-2</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figures_android_setup_welcome_screen">&#13;
<img alt="Welcome Screen" src="assets/nmdv_1502.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 15-2. </span>Welcome screen</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Then you can choose an install type, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#figures_android_setup_install_type">Figure 15-3</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figures_android_setup_install_type">&#13;
<img alt="Install Type" src="assets/nmdv_1503.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 15-3. </span>Install type</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Just<a data-primary="Android Studio" data-secondary="setup" data-tertiary="install type screen" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214730232"/> pick Standard for now. You can make customizations later.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You<a data-primary="Android Studio" data-secondary="setup" data-tertiary="select theme screen" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214728504"/> may be prompted to select a light, or dark, theme for the IDE, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#figures_android_setup_select_theme">Figure 15-4</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figures_android_setup_select_theme">&#13;
<img alt="Select Theme" src="assets/nmdv_1504.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 15-4. </span>Select theme</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Ideally, at this point you’ll just need to verify your previous choices, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#figures_android_setup_verify">Figure 15-5</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figures_android_setup_verify">&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 15-5. </span>Verify settings</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Click<a data-primary="Android Studio" data-secondary="setup" data-tertiary="verify settings screen" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214720648"/> Finish if you’re satisfied, and you’ll see Android Studio contact various servers to update its components, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#figures_android_setup_download_components">Figure 15-6</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="figures_android_setup_download_components">&#13;

&#13;
<p>To<a data-primary="Android Studio" data-secondary="setup" data-tertiary="install components screen" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46177214715912"/> enable Java 8 features, which are used throughout this book, add the following to your module-level <code>build.gradle</code> file (code block from the Android developer docs):</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>Once that’s complete, you’ll immediately be taken to the New Project flow. From here, this is the same process you’ll use when you create your next and subsequent projects in Android Studio, so we’ll do a deep dive into this workflow in <a data-type="xref" href="ch16.html#app_project">Chapter 16</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;

It’s a very full-featured application that’s been around for a long time in various forms. Xcode itself has been around through the transition from PowerPC desktops to Intel-based processers in the mid-2000s to ARM-based iOS devices starting with the launch of the iPhone; it was there in the days of Objective-C and in the nascent moments of Swift. It’s an amazing piece of software that will be delight and frustrate you to no end.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>This book was written with Xcode 11 and Swift 5 in mind. Xcode 11 was launched in September 2019. Generally speaking, Xcode doesn’t change much between versions, so if you are on an older or newer version of Xcode, it’s possible you might have to hunt for commands that have changed names but are still, fundamentally, the same operation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once you open up Xcode for the first time, you’ll be prompted to install additional components that add command-line tools to your environment. We definitely recommend you install these tools to make life a little easier in the future.</p>&#13;

<h1>What We’ve Learned</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Within this introductory chapter, we’ve covered a lot of ground. We learned about the reasons why we believe in true, native development over cross-platform apps. The amount of time saved in developing shared code is often lost due to the amount of extra time spent working around incomplete vendor functionality, the separate code necessary for different user interface behavior, and the opportunity cost in waiting for third-party library support for new platform functionality.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We also spent some time getting each environment set up and ready for development. We installed Android Studio and Xcode on our machines. Now, it looks like we’re ready to get rolling and start building our first app. But first, let’s learn a little bit about what we’ll be building in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
