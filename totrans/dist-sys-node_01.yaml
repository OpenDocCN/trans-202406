- en: 'Between the *NodeSchool San Francisco* and *Ann Arbor PHP MySQL* groups, I’ve
    dedicated several years of my life to teaching others how to program. By now I’ve
    worked with hundreds of students, often starting with the mundane process of installing
    required software and configuring it. Afterwards, with a little bit of code and
    a whole lot of explanation, we get to the part where the student’s program runs
    and it all just “clicks.” I can always tell when it happens: the student smiles
    and they discuss the possibilities of their newly acquired skill as if it were
    a power-up in a video game.'

- en: My goal is to re-create that tingle of excitement for you, the reader, throughout
    this book. Within these pages you’ll find many hands-on examples where you get
    to run various backing services on your development machine and then interact
    with them using example Node.js application code. With that comes lots of explanation
    and small tangents to appease the curious.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you’re finished with this book, you will have installed and run many different
    services and, with each of these services, you will have written Node.js application
    code to interact with them. This book places a greater emphasis on these interactions
    than it does on examining Node.js application code.

- en: JavaScript is a powerful language capable of developing both frontend and backend
    applications. This makes it too easy to go all-in on just learning the language
    while shying away from periphery technologies. The thesis of this book is that
    we JavaScript engineers benefit greatly by having first-hand experience with technologies
    that many assume only engineers using more traditional enterprise platforms like
    Java or .NET are familiar with.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book won’t teach you how to use Node.js, and to benefit the most from it,
    you should have already written several Node.js applications and have a concrete
    understanding of JavaScript. That said, this book does cover some advanced and
    lesser-known concepts about Node.js and JavaScript, such as [“The Single-Threaded
    Nature of JavaScript”](ch01.html#ch_introduction_sec_js_overview) and [“The Node.js
    Event Loop”](ch01.html#ch_introduction_sec_eventloop). You should also be familiar
    with the basics of HTTP, have used at least one database for persisting state,
    and know how easy and dangerous it is to maintain state within a running Node.js
    process.

- en: Perhaps you already work at a company that has infrastructure for running backend
    services and you’re eager to learn how it works and how your Node.js applications
    can benefit from it. Or maybe you’ve got a Node.js application that you’re running
    as a side project and you’re tired of it crashing. You might even be the CTO of
    a young startup and are determined to meet the demands of your growing userbase.
    If any of these situations sound familiar, then this book is for you.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js is often used for building frontend web applications. This book doesn’t
    cover any topics related to frontend development or browser concerns. A wealth
    of books are already available that cover such content. Instead, the goal of this
    book is to have you integrate backend Node.js services with various services that
    support modern distributed systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By the time you’re done reading this book, you’ll have an understanding of many
    technologies required to run Node.js services in a production environment. For
    example, what it takes to deploy and scale an application, how to make it redundant
    and resilient to failure, how to reliably communicate with other distributed processes,
    and how to observe the health of the application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You won’t become an expert on these systems just by reading this book. The operational
    work required to tune and shard and deploy scalable ELK services to production,
    for example, isn’t touched on. However, you will understand how to run a local
    ELK instance, send it logs from your Node.js service, and create a dashboard for
    visualizing the service’s health (this is covered in [“Logging with ELK”](ch04.html#ch_monitoring_sec_log)).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book certainly doesn’t cover all of the technology used by your particular
    employer. Although [Chapter 7](ch07.html#ch_kubernetes) discusses Kubernetes,
    a technology for orchestrating the deployments of application code, your employer
    may instead use a different solution like Apache Mesos. Or perhaps you rely on
    a version of Kubernetes in a cloud environment where the underlying implementation
    is hidden from you. At any rate, by learning about tools in the different layers
    of a distributed backend service stack, you’ll more easily understand other technology
    stacks that you may encounter.
