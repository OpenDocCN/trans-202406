<p><a data-primary="development environment" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch01-asciidoc0"/>John<a data-primary="development environment" data-secondary="about" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339520978088"/> Wooden, the late coach of the UCLA men’s basketball team, is one of the most successful coaches of all time, winning 10 national&#13;
championships in a 12-year period. His teams consisted of top&#13;
recruits, including hall-of-fame players such as Lew Alcindor (Kareem&#13;
Abdul-Jabbar) and Bill Walton. On the first day of practice, Wooden would sit down each of his new recruits, players who had been the best in the United States in high school, and teach them to put on their socks properly. When asked about this,&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/lnZkf">Wooden&#13;
stated</a> that “it’s the little details that make the big things come&#13;
about.”</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Chefs use the term <em>mise en place</em>, meaning “everything in its place,” to describe the practice of preparing the tools and ingredients&#13;
required for the menu prior to cooking. This preparation enables the&#13;
kitchen’s cooks to successfully prepare meals during busy rushes, as the small details have already been considered. Much like Coach Wooden’s players and chefs preparing for a dinner rush, it is worth dedicating time to setting up our development environment.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>A useful development environment does not require expensive software or top-of-the-line hardware. In fact, I’d encourage you to start simple, use open source software, and grow your tools with you. Though a runner prefers a specific brand of sneakers and a carpenter may always reach for her favorite hammer, it took time and experience to establish these preferences. Experiment with tools, observe others, and over time you will create the environment that works best for you.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this chapter we’ll install a text editor, Node.js, Git, MongoDB, and several helpful JavaScript packages as well as locate our terminal application. It’s possible that you already have a development environment that works well for you; however, we will also be installing several required tools that will be used throughout the book. If you’re like me and typically skip over the instruction manual, I’d still encourage you to read through this guide.</p>&#13;

<h1>Your Text Editor</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="development environment" data-secondary="text editor" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339520969640"/>Text editors are a lot like clothes. We all need them, but our preferences may vary wildly. Some like simple and well constructed. Some prefer the flashy paisley pattern. There’s no wrong decision, and you should use whatever makes you most <span class="keep-together">comfortable.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you don’t already have a favorite, I highly recommend&#13;
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</a>. It’s an open&#13;
source editor that is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.&#13;
Additionally, it offers built-in features to simplify development&#13;
and is easily modified with community extensions. It’s even built&#13;
using JavaScript!</p>&#13;

terminal. For most development tasks, this may be all you need.&#13;
Personally, I find using a dedicated terminal client preferable as I&#13;
find it easier to manage multiple tabs and use more dedicated window&#13;
space on my machine. I’d suggest trying both and finding what works&#13;
best for you.</p>&#13;

On the Windows operating system, starting with Windows 7, the program is <a data-primary="PowerShell" data-seealso="terminal" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339517245640"/>PowerShell. The name of the terminal for Linux distributions may vary, but often includes “Terminal.”</p>&#13;

You can do this using the&#13;
<code>cd</code> command, which stands for “change directory.”</p>&#13;
<div data-type="tip"><h1>Command-Line Prompts</h1>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="command-line prompts, terminal" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339517233864"/>Terminal instructions often include a <code>$</code> or <code>&gt;</code> at the start of the line. These are used to designate the prompt and should not be copied. In this book, I’ll indicate the terminal prompt with a dollar sign (<code>$</code>). When entering instructions into your terminal application, do not type the <code>$</code>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When you open your terminal application, you’ll be presented with a&#13;
cursor prompt, where you may enter commands. By default, you’re in your computer’s home directory. If you haven’t already, I’d recommend making a <em>Projects</em> folder that is a sub-directory within your home directory. This folder can house all of your development projects. You create a <em>Projects</em> directory and navigate into that folder like so:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting"><code class="c"># first type cd, this will ensure you are in your root directory</code>&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd</code>&#13;
<code class="c"># next, if you don't already have a Projects directory, you can create one</code>&#13;
<code class="c"># this will create Projects as a subfolder in your system's root directory</code>&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code>mkdir Projects&#13;
<code class="c"># finally you can cd into the Projects directory</code>&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd </code>Projects</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the future, you can navigate to your <em>Projects</em> directory as follows:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting"><code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd</code> <code class="c"># ensure you are in the root directory</code>&#13;
<code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd </code>Projects</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now let’s say you have a folder called <em>jseverywhere</em> in your&#13;
<em>Projects</em> directory. You can type <code>cd jseverywhere</code> from the <em>Projects</em>&#13;
directory to navigate into that folder. To navigate backward into a directory (in this case, to <em>Projects</em>), you would type <code>cd ..</code> (the <code>cd</code> command followed by two periods).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>All together, this would look something like:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">&gt; <code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd</code> <code class="c"># ensure you are in your root directory</code>&#13;
&gt; <code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd </code>Projects <code class="c"># navigate from root dir to Projects dir</code>&#13;
/Projects &gt; <code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd </code>jseverywhere <code class="c"># navigate from Projects dir to jsevewehre dir</code>&#13;
/Projects/jseverwhere &gt; <code class="nv">$ </code><code class="nb">cd</code> .. <code class="c"># navigate back from jseverwhere to Projects</code>&#13;
/Projects &gt; <code class="nv">$ </code><code class="c"># Prompt is currently in the Projects dir</code></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If this is new to you, spend some time navigating through your files&#13;
until you’re comfortable. I’ve found that filesystem issues are a&#13;
common tripping point for budding developers. Having a grasp of this will provide you with a solid foundation for establishing your workflows.</p>&#13;

If you use a Mac, it will dramatically simplify your development environment. To install Homebrew, either head over to <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://brew.sh"><em>brew.sh</em></a> to copy and paste the install command, or type the following in a single line:</p>&#13;

things like copy code repositories, merge code with others, and&#13;
create branches of your own code that do not impact one another. Git will be helpful for “cloning” this book’s sample code repositories, meaning it will allow you to directly copy a folder of sample code. Depending on your operating system, Git may already be installed. Type the following into your terminal window:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting"><code class="nv">$ </code>git --version</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If a number is returned, congrats—you’re all set! If not, visit&#13;
<a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://git-scm.com"><em>git-scm.com</em></a> to install Git, or use Homebrew for&#13;
macOS. Once you’ve completed the installation steps, once again type&#13;
<strong><code>git --version</code></strong> into your terminal to verify that it has worked.</p>&#13;

iOS and Android projects with React Native. We will need to install the&#13;
Expo command-line tool and, optionally (though recommended), the Expo app for iOS or Android. We’ll cover this in more detail in the mobile application portion of the book, but if you’re interested in getting a head start, visit <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://expo.io"><em>expo.io</em></a> to learn more. To install the command-line tools, type the following into your terminal:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">npm install -g expo-cli</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Using the <code>-g</code> global flag will make the <code>expo-cli</code> tool globally available to your machine’s Node.js installation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To install the Expo mobile application, visit the Apple App Store or Google Play Store on your device.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Prettier" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45339513184808">&#13;
<h1>Prettier</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="development environment" data-secondary="Prettier" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513183560"/><a data-primary="Prettier" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513195432"/>Prettier is a code formatting tool with support for a number of&#13;
languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GraphQL, and Markdown. It&#13;
makes it easy to follow basic formatting rules, meaning that when&#13;
you run the Prettier command, your code is automatically formatted to follow a standard set of best practices. Even better, you can configure your&#13;
editor to do this automatically every time you save a file. This means&#13;
that you’ll never again have a project with issues like inconsistent&#13;
spaces and mixed quotes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I recommend installing Prettier globally on your machine and configuring&#13;
a plug-in for your editor. To install Prettier globally, go to your&#13;
command-line and type:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting">npm install -g prettier</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once you’ve installed Prettier, visit <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://prettier.io"><em>Prettier.io</em></a>&#13;
to find the plug-in for your text editor. With the editor plug-in&#13;
installed, I recommend adding the following settings within your&#13;
editor’s settings file:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="bash" data-type="programlisting"><code class="s2">"editor.formatOnSave"</code>: <code class="nb">true</code>,&#13;
<code class="s2">"prettier.requireConfig"</code>: <code class="nb">true</code></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These settings will automatically format files on save whenever a&#13;
<em>.prettierrc</em> configuration file is within the project. The <em>.prettierrc</em> file specifies options for Prettier to follow. Now whenever that file is present, your editor will automatically reformat your code to meet the conventions of the project. Each project within this book will include a <em>.prettierrc</em> file.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="ESLint" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45339513189864">&#13;

&#13;
<p><a data-primary="development environment" data-secondary="ESLint" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513188696"/><a data-primary="ESLint" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513187720"/>ESLint is a code linter for JavaScript. A linter differs from a&#13;
formatter, such as Prettier, in that a linter also checks for code&#13;
quality rules, such as unused variables, infinite loops, and unreachable&#13;
code that falls after a return. As with Prettier, I recommend&#13;
installing the ESLint plug-in for your favorite text editor. This will&#13;
alert you to errors in real time as you write your code. You can find a&#13;
list of editor plug-ins on the <a href="https://oreil.ly/H3Zao">ESLint website</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Similar to Prettier, projects can specify the ESLint rules they would&#13;
like to follow within an <em>.eslintrc</em> file. This provides project&#13;
maintainers with fine-grained control over their code preferences and a means&#13;
to automatically enforce coding standards. Each of the projects within&#13;
this book will include a helpful but permissive set of ESLint rules,&#13;
aimed at helping you to avoid common pitfalls.</p>&#13;

<h1>Making Things Look Nice</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This is optional, but I’ve found that I enjoy programming just a bit&#13;
more when I find my setup aesthetically pleasing. I can’t help it; I&#13;
have a degree in the arts. Take some time and test out different color&#13;
themes and typefaces. Personally, I’ve grown to love the <a href="https://draculatheme.com">Dracula Theme</a>, which is a color theme available for nearly every text editor and terminal, along with Adobe’s&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/PktVn">Source Code Pro typeface</a>.</p>&#13;

<h1>Conclusion</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In this chapter we’ve set up a working and flexible JavaScript development environment on our computer. One of the great joys of programming is personalizing your environment. I encourage you to experiment with the themes, colors, and tools that you use to make this environment your own.  In the next section of the book, we will put this environment to work by developing our API application.<a data-startref="ix_ch01-asciidoc0" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513136392"/><a data-primary="API" data-see="application programming interface" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513135688"/><a data-primary="CSS" data-see="Cascading Style Sheets" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513134776"/><a data-primary="state" data-secondary="web authentication and" data-see="web authentication and state" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513133832"/><a data-primary="UI" data-see="user interfaces" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45339513132648"/></p>&#13;
