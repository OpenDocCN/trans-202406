<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
<p>OpenShift, the Red Hat distribution of Kubernetes, is rapidly becoming the <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="OpenShift (Red Hat)" data-secondary="about" data-tertiary="Kubernetes container orchestration" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358197692120"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="containerized applications in OpenShift" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358197690264"/>platform of choice for containerized applications. As enterprises attempt to scale and operate OpenShift, there are many practices that must be understood to manage resources, expose those resources for application teams, govern those resources, and deliver changes continuously to those environments.</p>&#13;
<p>Based on our expertise built on managing and supporting thousands of bare metal and virtual machine clusters for some of the largest enterprise applications, we will focus on how to operationalize both basic Kubernetes and OpenShift with specific techniques and examples to make your organization effective.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>&#13;
<p>Although a lot of content exists on how to get started with Kubernetes and OpenShift, our goal was to focus on a book that covered more advanced concepts, such as the effective management of cluster resources and availability models that can be applied to ensure business continuity. In addition, we wanted to dig deep into topics, tools, and best practices that are critical to operating Kubernetes and OpenShift successfully in production environments. We give particular attention to topics like security, advanced resource management, continuous delivery, multicluster management, and high availability. Additionally, the book explores best practices for supporting <a contenteditable="false" data-primary="hybrid cloud applications definition" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45358202638760"/>hybrid cloud applications, which are applications that integrate the best features and functions from a combination of multiple cloud environments coupled with traditional IT environments. In this book, we offer our in-depth knowledge and experience of these production-level topics to the broader OpenShift and Kubernetes community.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="less_space">Who This Book Is For</h1>&#13;
<p>This book is for DevOps engineers, Kubernetes and OpenShift platform operations engineers, site reliability engineers, NetOps engineers, cloud native computing application developers, and IT architects. In addition, the book will be of particular interest to those who either create and manage Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters or consume and use these platforms for delivering applications and services.</p>&#13;

<h1>How This Book Is Organized</h1>&#13;
<p>This book is structured to enable operators and developers to gain a solid understanding of the advanced concepts required to run Kubernetes and OpenShift in production. <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#kubernetes_and_openshift_overview">Chapter 1</a> provides an overview of both basic Kubernetes and OpenShift. It then discusses fundamental concepts of Kubernetes and describes the Kubernetes architecture. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#getting_started_with_openshift_and_kuber">Chapter 2</a>, we give a primer on the relationship between OpenShift and Kubernetes and describe how to get a variety of Kubernetes and OpenShift environments up and running. <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#advanced_resource_management">Chapter 3</a> is a deep dive into advanced resource management topics, including specialized scheduling, resource reservations, specialized node types, and capacity planning and management. <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#single_cluster_availability">Chapter 4</a> covers key fundamentals for supporting high availability inside a single cluster. In <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#continuous_delivery_across_clusters">Chapter 5</a>, we present an overview of production-level approaches for continuous delivery and promotion of code across multiple enterprise clusters. Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch06.html#multicluster_fleets_provision_and_upgrad">6</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch07.html#multicluster_policy_configuration">7</a> focus on the use of multiple production clusters. In these chapters, we describe several hybrid cloud use cases, and we cover in depth such advanced topics as multicluster provisioning, upgrading, and policy support. These concepts are reinforced in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#working_example_of_multicluster_applicat">Chapter 8</a>, where we provide a working example of multicluster application delivery. Finally, in <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#the_future_of_kubernetes_and_openshift">Chapter 9</a> we conclude with a discussion of the future of Kubernetes and OpenShift and list additional references on a variety of helpful topics for running applications in production Kubernetes and OpenShift environments.</p>&#13;

<h1 class="less_space">Acknowledgments</h1>&#13;
<p>We would like to thank the entire Kubernetes and OpenShift communities for their passion, dedication, and tremendous commitment to these open source projects. Without the code developers, code reviewers, documentation authors, and operators contributing to these projects over the years, Kubernetes and OpenShift would not have the rich feature sets, strong adoption, and large ecosystems they enjoy today.</p>&#13;
<p>We would like to extend our grateful thanks to the technical reviewers who provided valuable feedback to this text: Dan “Pop” Papandrea, Daniel Berg, Joshua Packer, Scott Berens, and Burr Sutter.</p>&#13;
<p>We would like to thank our Kubernetes colleagues Clayton Coleman, Derek Carr, David Eads, Paul Morie, Zach Corleissen, Jim Angel, Tim Bannister, Celeste Horgan, Irvi Aini, Karen Bradshaw, Kaitlyn Barnard, Taylor Dolezal, Jorge Castro, Jason DeTiberus, Stephen Augustus, Guang Ya Liu, Sahdev Zala, Wei Huang, Michael Brown, Jonathan Berkhahn, Martin Hickey, Chris Luciano, Srinivas Brahmaroutu, Morgan Bauer, Qiming Teng, Richard Theis, Tyler Lisowski, Bill Lynch, Jennifer Rondeau, Seth McCombs, Steve Perry, and Joe Heck for the wonderful collaboration over the years.</p>&#13;
<p>We would also like to thank the contributors to the Open Cluster Management project and its related projects, including the OpenShift Hive project, Open Policy Agent, and ArgoCD.</p>&#13;
<p>We would like to thank the many open source contributors who have enabled projects and examples beyond Kubernetes, in particular the authors and originators of the example PAC-MAN application, including Ivan Font, Mario Vázquez, Jason DeTiberus, Davis Phillips, and Pep Turró Mauri. We would also like to thank the authors and contributors of the many example Open Cluster Management policies, including Yu Cao, Christian Stark, and Jaya Ramanathan.</p>&#13;
<p>We would also like to thank our editor, Angela Rufino, for her patience in working through the book writing process during a very dynamic year and a worldwide pandemic. In addition, we would like to thank our copyeditor, Shannon Turlington, for her meticulous review of our work and the large number of suggested improvements she provided.</p>&#13;
<p>A very special thanks to Willie Tejada, Todd Moore, Bob Lord, Dave Lindquist, Kevin Myers, Jeff Brent, Jason McGee, Chris Ferris, Vince Brunssen, Alex Tarpinian, Jeff Borek, Nimesh Bhatia, Briana Frank, and Jake Morlock for all of their support and encouragement during this endeavor.</p>&#13;
