<h1 class="calibre14">Preface</h1>


<p class="author1">In the spring of 2016, I visited my old coworker Evan Martin at Google’s San Francisco office and asked him what he was excited about. I’d asked him this same question many times over the years because the answers were wide-ranging and unpredictable but always interesting: C++ build tools, Linux audio drivers, online crosswords, emacs plugins. This time, Evan was excited about TypeScript and Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p class="author1">I was surprised! I’d heard of TypeScript before, but I knew only that it was created by Microsoft and that I mistakenly believed it had something to do with .NET. As a lifelong Linux user, I couldn’t believe that Evan had hopped on team Microsoft.</p>

<p class="author1">Then Evan showed me vscode and the TypeScript playground and I was instantly converted. Everything was so fast, and the code intelligence made it easy to build a mental model of the type system. After years of writing type annotations in JSDoc comments for the Closure Compiler, this felt like typed JavaScript that really worked. And Microsoft had built a cross-platform text editor on top of Chromium? Perhaps this was a language and toolchain worth learning.</p>

<p class="author1">I’d recently joined Sidewalk Labs and was writing our first JavaScript. The codebase was still small enough that Evan and I were able to convert it all to TypeScript over the next few days.</p>

<p class="author1">I’ve been hooked ever since. TypeScript is more than just a type system. It also brings a whole suite of language services which are fast and easy to use. The cumulative effect is that TypeScript doesn’t just make JavaScript development safer: it also makes it more fun!</p>

<h1 class="calibre16">Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p class="author1">The <em class="calibre3">Effective</em> books are intended to be the “standard second book” on their topic. You’ll get the most out of <em class="calibre3">Effective TypeScript</em> if you have some previous practical experience working with JavaScript and TypeScript. My goal with this book is not to teach you TypeScript or JavaScript but to help you advance from a beginning or intermediate user to an expert. The items in this book do this by helping you build mental models of how TypeScript and its ecosystem work, making you aware of pitfalls and traps to avoid, and by guiding you toward using TypeScript’s many capabilities in the most effective ways possible. Whereas a reference book will explain the five ways that a language lets you do X, an <em class="calibre3">Effective</em> book will tell you which of those five to use and why.</p>

<p class="author1">TypeScript has evolved rapidly over the past few years, but my hope is that it has stabilized enough that the content in this book will remain valid for years to come. This book focuses primarily on the language itself, rather than any frameworks or build tools. You won’t find any examples of how to use React or Angular with TypeScript, or how to configure TypeScript to work with webpack, Babel, or Rollup. The advice in this book should be relevant to all TypeScript users.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Why I Wrote This Book" data-type="sect1" class="praise"><div class="praise" id="idm45331689484712">
<h1 class="calibre16">Why I Wrote This Book</h1>

<p class="author1">When I first started working at Google, I was given a copy of the third edition of <i class="calibre">Effective C++</i>. It was unlike any other programming book I’d read. It made no attempt to be accessible to beginners or to be a complete guide to the language. Rather than telling you what the different features of C++ did, it told you how you should and should not use them. It did so through dozens of short, specific items motivated by concrete examples.</p>

<p class="author1">The effect of reading all these examples while using the language daily was unmistakable. I’d used C++ before, but for the first time I felt comfortable with it and knew how to think about the choices it presented me. In later years I would have similar experiences reading <em class="calibre3">Effective Java</em> and <em class="calibre3">Effective JavaScript</em>.</p>

<p class="author1">If you’re already comfortable working in a few different programming languages, then diving straight into the odd corners of a new one can be an effective way to challenge your mental models and learn what makes it different. I’ve learned an enormous amount about TypeScript from writing this book. I hope you’ll have the same experience reading it!</p>

<div class="praise" id="idm45331689453080">
<h1 class="calibre16">How This Book Is Organized</h1>

<p class="author1">This book is a collection of “items,” each of which is a short technical essay that gives you specific advice about some aspect of TypeScript. The items are grouped thematically into chapters, but feel free to jump around and read whichever ones look most interesting to you.</p>

<p class="author1">Each item’s title conveys the key takeaway. These are the things you should remember as you’re using TypeScript, so it’s worth skimming the table of contents to get them in your head. If you’re writing documentation, for example, and have a nagging sense that you shouldn’t be writing type information, then you’ll know to go read <a data-full-item="1" href="ch04.html#jsdoc-repeat" class="calibre9">Item 30: Don’t repeat type information in documentation</a>.</p>

<p class="author1">The text of the item motivates the advice in the title and backs it up with concrete examples and technical arguments. Almost every point made in this book is demonstrated through example code. I tend to read technical books by looking at the examples and skimming the prose, and I assume you do something similar. I hope you’ll read the prose and explanations! But the main points should still come across if you skim the examples.</p>

<p class="author1">After reading the item, you should understand why it will help you use TypeScript more effectively. You’ll also know enough to understand if it doesn’t apply to your situation. Scott Meyers, the author of <i class="calibre">Effective C++</i>, gives a memorable example of this. He met a team of engineers who wrote software that ran on missiles. They knew they could ignore his advice about preventing resource leaks, because their programs would always terminate when the missile hit the target and their hardware blew up. I’m not aware of any missiles with JavaScript runtimes, but the James Webb Space Telescope has one, so you never know!</p>

<p class="author1">Finally, each item ends with “Things to Remember.” These are a few bullet points that summarize the item. If you’re skimming through, you can read these to get a sense for what the item is saying and whether you’d like to read more. You should still read the item! But the summary will do in a pinch.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Conventions in TypeScript Code Samples" data-type="sect1" class="praise"><div class="praise" id="idm45331689651720">
<h1 class="calibre16">Conventions in TypeScript Code Samples</h1>

<p class="author1">All<a data-primary="code samples, conventions used in" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45331689650152" class="calibre9"/> code samples are TypeScript except where it’s clear from context that they are JSON, GraphQL, or some other language. Much of the experience of using TypeScript involves interacting with your editor, which presents some challenges in print. I’ve adopted a few conventions to make this work.</p>

<p class="author1">Most editors surface errors using squiggly underlines. To see the full error message, you hover over the underlined text. To indicate an error in a code sample, I put squiggles in a comment line under the place where the error occurs:</p>

<pre data-code-language="ts" data-type="programlisting" class="calibre17"><code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">str</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s">'not a number'</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">num</code>: <code class="nx">number</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">str</code><code class="p">;</code>
 <code class="c">// ~~~ Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'</code></pre>

<p class="author1">I occasionally edit the error messages for clarity and brevity, but I never remove an error. If you copy/paste a code sample into your editor, you should get exactly the errors indicated, no more no less.</p>

<p class="author1">To draw attention to the lack of an error, I use <code class="calibre18">// OK</code>:</p>

<pre data-code-language="ts" data-type="programlisting" class="calibre17"><code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">str</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s">'not a number'</code><code class="p">;</code>
<code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">num</code>: <code class="nx">number</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="nx">str</code> <code class="kd">as</code> <code class="nx">any</code><code class="p">;</code>  <code class="c">// OK</code></pre>

<p class="author1">You should be able to hover over a symbol in your editor to see what TypeScript considers its type. To indicate this in text, I use a comment starting with “type is”:</p>

<pre data-code-language="ts" data-type="programlisting" class="calibre17"><code class="kd">let</code> <code class="nx">v</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="p">{</code><code class="nx">str</code><code class="o">:</code> <code class="s">'hello'</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="nx">num</code>: <code class="nx">42</code><code class="p">};</code>  <code class="c">// Type is { str: string; num: number; }</code></pre>

<p class="author1">The type is for the first symbol on the line (<code class="calibre18">v</code> in this case) or for the result of a function call:</p>

<pre data-code-language="ts" data-type="programlisting" class="calibre17"><code class="s">'four score'</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">split</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="s">' '</code><code class="p">);</code>  <code class="c">// Type is string[]</code></pre>

<p class="author1">This matches the type you’d see in your editor character for character. In the case of function calls you may need to assign to a temporary variable to see the type.</p>

<p class="author1">I will occasionally introduce no-op statements to indicate the type of a variable on a specific line of code:</p>

<pre data-code-language="ts" data-type="programlisting" class="calibre17"><code class="kd">function</code> <code class="nx">foo</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">x</code>: <code class="kd">string</code><code class="o">|</code><code class="kt">string</code><code class="p">[])</code> <code class="p">{</code>
  <code class="kd">if</code> <code class="p">(</code><code class="nb">Array</code><code class="p">.</code><code class="nx">isArray</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="nx">x</code><code class="p">))</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="nx">x</code><code class="p">;</code>  <code class="c">// Type is string[]</code>
  <code class="p">}</code> <code class="kd">else</code> <code class="p">{</code>
    <code class="nx">x</code><code class="p">;</code>  <code class="c">// Type is string</code>
  <code class="p">}</code>
<code class="p">}</code></pre>

<p class="author1">The <code class="calibre18">x;</code> lines are only there to demonstrate the type in each branch of the conditional. You don’t need to (and shouldn’t) include statements like this in your own code.</p>

<p class="author1">Unless it’s otherwise noted or clear from context, code samples are intended to be checked with the <code class="calibre18">--strict</code> flag. All samples were verified using TypeScript 3.7.0-beta.</p>

<h1 class="calibre16">Acknowledgments</h1>

<p class="author1">There are many people who helped make this book possible. Thanks to Evan Martin for introducing me to TypeScript and showing me how to think about it. To Douwe Osinga for connecting me with O’Reilly and being supportive of the project. To Brett Slatkin for advice on structure and for showing me that someone I knew could write an <em class="calibre3">Effective</em> book. To Scott Meyers for coming up with this format and for his “Effective <em class="calibre3">Effective</em> Books” blog post, which provided essential guidance.</p>

<p class="author1">To my reviewers, Rick Battagline, Ryan Cavanaugh, Boris Cherny, Yakov Fain, Jesse Hallett, and Jason Killian. To all my coworkers at Sidewalk who learned TypeScript with me over the years. To everyone at O’Reilly who helped make this book happen: Angela Rufino, Jennifer Pollock, Deborah Baker, Nick Adams, and Jasmine Kwityn. To the TypeScript NYC crew, Jason, Orta, and Kirill, and to all the speakers. Many items were inspired by talks at the Meetup, as described in the following list:</p>

Thanks to Marius Schulz for the TypeScript Weekly newsletter. While it’s only occasionally weekly, it’s always an excellent source of material and a great way to keep up with TypeScript. To Anders, Daniel, Ryan, and the whole TypeScript team at Microsoft for the talks and all the feedback on issues. Most of my issues were misunderstandings, but there is nothing quite so satisfying as filing a bug and immediately seeing Anders Hejlsberg himself fix it! Finally, thanks to Alex for being so supportive during this project and so understanding of all the working vacations, mornings, evenings, and weekends I needed to complete it.</p>
