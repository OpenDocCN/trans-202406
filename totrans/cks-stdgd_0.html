<h1>Preface</h1>
<p><a data-primary="CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46394767275088"/>The Kubernetes certification program has been around since 2018, or five years as of this writing.  During this time, security has become more and more important everywhere, including the Kubernetes world. Recently, the role of <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/cks">Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)</a> has been added to the certification track to address the need. Security can have different facets, and the way you address those concerns can be very diverse. That’s where the Kubernetes ecosystem comes into play. Apart from Kubernetes built-in security features, many tools have evolved that help with identifying and fixing security risks. As a Kubernetes administrator, you need to be familiar with the wide range of concepts and tools to harden your clusters and applications.</p>
<p><a data-primary="CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46394768152944"/><a data-primary="CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46394767290928"/>The CKS certification program was created to verify competence on security-based topics, and it requires a successful pass of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka">Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)</a> exam before you can register. If you are completely new to the Kubernetes certification program, then I would recommend exploring the CKA or <a href="https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad">Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)</a> program first.</p>
<p>In this study guide, I will explore the topics covered in the CKS exam to fully prepare you to pass the certification exam. We’ll look at determining when and how you should apply the core concepts of Kubernetes and external tooling to secure cluster components, cluster configuration, and applications running in a Pod. I will also offer tips to help you better prepare for the exam and share my personal experience with getting ready for all aspects of it.</p>
<p>The CKS is different from the typical multiple-choice format of other certifications. It’s completely performance based and requires you to demonstrate deep knowledge of the tasks at hand under immense time pressure. Are you ready to pass the test on the first go?</p>

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>
<p><a data-primary="Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Study Guide (Muschko)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46394767255360"/><a data-primary="Muschko, Benjamin" data-secondary="Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Study Guide" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46394767304544"/>This book is for anyone who already passed the CKA exam and wants to broaden their knowledge in the realm of security. Given that you need to pass the CKA exam before signing up for the CKS, you should already be familiar with the format of the exam questions and environment. <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#exam-details-and-resources">Chapter 1</a> only briefly recaps the general aspects of the exam curriculum, but it highlights the information specific to the CKS exam. If you have not taken the CKA exam yet, I recommend taking a step by reading the <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/cka-study-guide"><em>Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Study Guide</em></a> (O’Reilly). The book will provide you with the foundation you need to get started with the CKS.</p>

<h1>What You Will Learn</h1>
<p><a data-primary="documentation" data-secondary="Kubernetes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm46394767318480"/>The content of the book condenses the most important aspects relevant to the CKS exam. Cloud-provider-specific Kubernetes implementations like AKS or GKE do not need to be considered. Given the plethora of configuration options available in Kubernetes, it’s almost impossible to cover all use cases and scenarios without duplicating the official documentation. Test takers are encouraged to reference the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/home">Kubernetes documentation</a> as the go-to compendium for broader exposure. External tools relevant to the CKS exam, such as Trivy or Falco, are only covered on a high level. Refer to their documentation to explore more features, functionality, and configuration options.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Structure of This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46394767212064">
<h1>Structure of This Book</h1>
<p>The outline of the book follows the CKS curriculum to a T. While there might be a more natural, didactical structure for learning Kubernetes in general, the curriculum outline will help test takers prepare for the exam by focusing on specific topics. As a result, you will find yourself cross-referencing other chapters of the book depending on your existing knowledge level.</p>
<p>Be aware that this book covers only the concepts relevant to the CKS exam. Foundational Kubernetes concepts and primitives are not discussed. Refer to the Kubernetes documentation or other books if you want to dive deeper.</p>
<p>Practical experience with Kubernetes is key to passing the exam. Each chapter contains a section named “Sample Exercises” with practice questions. Solutions to those questions can be found in the <a data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#appendix-a">Appendix</a>.</p>

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>
<p>Some code snippets in the book use the backslash character (<code>\</code>) to break up a single line into multiple lines to make it fit the page. You will need to rectify the code manually if you are copy-pasting it directly from the book content to a terminal or editor. The better choice is to refer to the code book’s <a href="https://github.com/bmuschko/cks-study-guide">GitHub repository</a>, which already has the proper formatting.</p>
<p>The GitHub repository is distributed under the Apache License 2.0. The code is free to use in commercial and open source projects. If you encounter an issue in the source code or if you have a question, open an issue in the <a href="https://oreil.ly/YTRzJ">GitHub issue tracker</a>. I’ll be happy to have a conversation and fix any issues that might arise.</p>
