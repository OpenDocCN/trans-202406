<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>Way back in olden times I wrote the first edition of the <em>Linux Cookbook</em>, which
was released unto a joyous world in 2004. It sold well, I heard from many
happy readers, and some are still my friends.</p>

<p>For a Linux book, 17 years old is ancient. Linux was 14 years old in 2004, a
wee baby computer operating system. Even so, it was already a popular
and widely used powerhouse, adapting to any role, from tiny embedded devices
to mainframes and supercomputers. The rapid growth of Linux is partly due to it
being a free clone of Unix, the most mature and powerful operating system of all.
The other major factor in the speedy growth and adoption of Linux is the absence
of barriers. Anyone can download and try it, and the source code is freely
available to anyone who wants to use and contribute to it.</p>

<p>At the time it was a great example of form following function, like my first car.
It ran, it was reliable, but it wasn’t pretty, and it needed a lot of custom
wiggling of this and jiggling of that to keep going. Running a Linux system back
then meant learning your way around a hodgepodge of commands, scripts, and
configuration files, and a fair bit of wiggling and jiggling. Software management, storage management, networking, audio, video, kernel management, process management…everything required a lot of hands-on work and continual study.</p>

<p>Some 17 years later, every important subsystem in Linux has substantially changed
and improved. Now all those manual chores we had to do for basic administration
are replaced by what I call “It Just Works Subsystems.” Every aspect of running
a Linux system is many times easier, and we can focus on using Linux to do cool
things instead of having to wiggle and jiggle this and that just to keep it
running.</p>

<p>I am delighted to present this greatly updated <em>Linux Cookbook</em> second edition,
and I hope you enjoy learning about all of this cool new goodness.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm46466164288248">
<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>

<p>This book is for people with some computer experience, though not necessarily Linux
experience. I’ve done my best to make it as accessible as possible for Linux
beginners. You should understand some basic networking concepts, such as IP addressing,
Ethernet, WiFi, client, and server. You should know basic computer hardware
and have some understanding of using the command line. If you need some help
with these, there are abundant resources for learning them; I did not want to get
bogged down in teaching material that is already well documented.</p>

<p>The recipes in this book are hands-on. My goal is for the reader to be successful
on the first try, though don’t feel badly if you are not. A general-purpose
Linux computer is an extremely complex machine, and there is a lot to learn. Be
patient, take your time, and read more than you want to. Chances are the answers
you want are just a few sentences away.</p>

<p>Every Linux has built-in documentation for commands called <em>man pages</em> (short for “manual pages”).
For example, <em>man 1 ls</em> documents the <em>ls</em>, or list directory contents, command. Type these commands exactly as shown in the book to open the correct man page. You can also find this information online.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Why I Wrote This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm46466181296488">
<h1>Why I Wrote This Book</h1>

<p>I have long wanted to write a book like this, that collects what I think are the
most necessary Linux skills in one book. Linux is everywhere, and no matter where
you find it, Linux is Linux, and the needed skills are the same. The tech world
moves fast, and I think you will find this book provides a solid foundation that
you can build on, no matter what direction your interests take you.</p>

<p>The cookbook format is especially good for teaching fundamentals because it shows
how to solve specific real-world problems and separates the wordy explanations
from the steps needed to accomplish a task.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Navigating This Book"><div class="sect1" id="idm46466181295320">
<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>

<p>This book is not a formal training course, where you start at the beginning and
work your way to the end. Instead, you can jump in anywhere and hopefully find
what you need.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-before less_space">It is roughly organized like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch01.xhtml#cha-install-linux">1</a>, <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.xhtml#managing-grub-bootloader">2</a>, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch03.xhtml#cha-stop-start">3</a> cover installing Linux, managing the bootloader, stopping and starting, and answer the “Where do I get Linux and how do I make it go” questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch04.xhtml#cha-systemd">Chapter 4</a> provides an introduction to managing services with systemd, which is
a big improvement from the old way of having to learn all manner of scripts,
configuration files, and commands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#cha-users-groups">Chapter 5</a> covers managing users and groups, <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.xhtml#cha-files-directories">Chapter 6</a> is about managing
files and directories, and <a data-type="xref" href="Images/ch07.html#cha-backup-recovery">Chapter 7</a> covers backups and recovery. These three
chapters are fundamental to system operations and security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch08.xhtml#cha-partitioning-parted">8</a>, <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch09.xhtml#cha-partitioning-gparted">9</a>, and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch11.xhtml#cha-create-filesystems">11</a> are all about partitioning and filesystems, which are
fundamental to managing data storage. Data management is the most important
aspect of computing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="Images/ch10.html#cha-discover-hardware">Chapter 10</a> is fun. This chapter is about finding detailed information about your computer hardware
without opening the case. Modern PC hardware self-reports a lot of information,
and Linux supplements this self-reporting with databases of additional information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch12.xhtml#cha-ssh">12</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch13.xhtml#cha-openvpn">13</a> teach setting up secure remote access, and <a data-type="xref" href="ch14.xhtml#cha-firewalld">Chapter 14</a>
introduces the excellent firewalld, the dynamic firewall that easily handles all
kinds of complicated scenarios, like roaming between different networks and
managing multiple network interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch15.xhtml#printing_on_linux">Chapter 15</a> introduces new features in CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System,
including “driverless” printing, which is especially good for mobile devices
because they can connect to a printer without having to download a lot of 
<span class="keep-together">software</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch16.xhtml#cha-dns-dhcp">Chapter 16</a> shows how to control your own LAN name services with the excellent
Dnsmasq. Dnsmasq has stayed current with support for new protocols, and the old
commands and configuration options have not changed. It is a first-rate name
server that seamlessly integrates DNS and DHCP for central management of IP
addressing and advertising network services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch17.xhtml#keeping_time_ntpd_chrony_and_timesyncd">Chapter 17</a> introduces chrony and timesyncd, two new implementations of the Network
Time Protocol (NTP). It also includes the old tried-and-true <em>ntp</em> server and client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="ch18.xhtml#cha-lan-gateway">Chapter 18</a> introduces installing Linux on the Raspberry Pi, the popular little
inexpensive single-board computer, and using it to build an internet
firewall/gateway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a data-type="xref" href="Images/ch19.html#cha-rescue-recovery">Chapter 19</a> shows how to use SystemRescue to reset lost Linux and Windows
passwords, rescue nonbooting systems, rescue data on a failing system, and
customize SystemRescue to make it even more useful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapters <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch20.xhtml#cha-trouble">20</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch21.xhtml#troubleshooting_networks">21</a> teach basic troubleshooting, with emphasis on searching log
files, probing networks, and probing and monitoring hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#appendix">Appendix</a> contains cheat sheets for managing software installation and
maintenance.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="idm46466164215112">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>I really lucked out with this book. My editor, Jeff Bleiel, has been unfailingly
supportive and helpful, contributed numerous improvements, and kept the whole
project organized and on track. If you think herding cats is difficult, try
being a book editor.</p>

<p>My intern, Kate Urness, was a Linux newbie at the start of this
adventure, which made her the perfect reviewer. She tested every recipe
and contributed substantially to the accuracy and clarity of the recipes. We drank
gallons of coffee and had fun together, which was also a substantial contribution.</p>

<p>Technical editor Daniel Barrett has a fabulous eye for detail, and relentlessly
pressed for more precision in wording and descriptions, and provided many
improvements. Providing a book full of commands is the easy part, explaining
how they work is the hard part. Every writer should be fortunate to have such a
technical editor.</p>

<p>Technical editor Jonathan Johnson found things everyone else missed, contributed
some super-cool command incantations, and provided humor, and let me tell you, I needed it.</p>

<p>Zan McQuade, acquisitions editor, started this whole crazy deal. There were talks
over the years about updating the <em>Linux Cookbook</em>, but Zan made it happen.</p>

<p>Great thundering herds of thanks to my wife, Terry, who fed the mules and cats
and dogs and me, provided much encouragement, and kept me from running away from
home because I lost my mind and agreed to write another book.</p>

<p>Special thanks to our cats, Duchess (<a data-type="xref" href="#duchess-feet">Figure P-1</a>), Stash (<a data-type="xref" href="#kittyboy">Figure P-2</a>), and Mad Max (<a data-type="xref" href="#max-recliner-remotes">Figure P-3</a>), who appear in this book.
They helped greatly by sleeping on my keyboard, not letting me have my chair,
and making mysterious loud crashes a lot.</p>
