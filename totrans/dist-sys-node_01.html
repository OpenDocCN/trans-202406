<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Between the <em>NodeSchool San Francisco</em> and <em>Ann Arbor PHP MySQL</em> groups, I’ve dedicated several years of my life to teaching others how to program. By now I’ve worked with hundreds of students, often starting with the mundane process of installing required software and configuring it. Afterwards, with a little bit of code and a whole lot of explanation, we get to the part where the student’s program runs and it all just “clicks.” I can always tell when it happens: the student smiles and they discuss the possibilities of their newly acquired skill as if it were a power-up in a video game.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>My goal is to re-create that tingle of excitement for you, the reader, throughout this book. Within these pages you’ll find many hands-on examples where you get to run various backing services on your development machine and then interact with them using example Node.js application code. With that comes lots of explanation and small tangents to appease the curious.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Once you’re finished with this book, you will have installed and run many different services and, with each of these services, you will have written Node.js application code to interact with them. This book places a greater emphasis on these interactions than it does on examining Node.js application code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>JavaScript is a powerful language capable of developing both frontend and backend applications. This makes it too easy to go all-in on just learning the language while shying away from periphery technologies. The thesis of this book is that we JavaScript engineers benefit greatly by having first-hand experience with technologies that many assume only engineers using more traditional enterprise platforms like Java or .NET are familiar with.</p>&#13;

<h1>Target Audience</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book won’t teach you how to use Node.js, and to benefit the most from it, &#13;
<span class="keep-together">you should</span> have already written several Node.js applications and have a concrete understanding of JavaScript. That said, this book does cover some advanced and &#13;
<span class="keep-together">lesser-known</span> concepts about Node.js and JavaScript, such as <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch_introduction_sec_js_overview">“The Single-Threaded Nature of JavaScript”</a> and <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#ch_introduction_sec_eventloop">“The Node.js Event Loop”</a>. You should also be familiar with the basics of HTTP, have used at least one database for persisting state, and know how easy and dangerous it is to maintain state within a running Node.js process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Perhaps you already work at a company that has infrastructure for running backend services and you’re eager to learn how it works and how your Node.js applications can benefit from it. Or maybe you’ve got a Node.js application that you’re running as a side project and you’re tired of it crashing. You might even be the CTO of a young startup and are determined to meet the demands of your growing userbase. If any of these situations sound familiar, then this book is for you.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Goals" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm46291210756696">&#13;
<h1>Goals</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Node.js is often used for building frontend web applications. This book doesn’t cover any topics related to frontend development or browser concerns. A wealth of books are already available that cover such content. Instead, the goal of this book is to have you integrate backend Node.js services with various services that support modern distributed systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By the time you’re done reading this book, you’ll have an understanding of many technologies required to run Node.js services in a production environment. For example, what it takes to deploy and scale an application, how to make it redundant and resilient to failure, how to reliably communicate with other distributed processes, and how to observe the health of the application.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You won’t become an expert on these systems just by reading this book. The operational work required to tune and shard and deploy scalable ELK services to production, for example, isn’t touched on. However, you will understand how to run a local ELK instance, send it logs from your Node.js service, and create a dashboard for visualizing the service’s health (this is covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ch_monitoring_sec_log">“Logging with ELK”</a>).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book certainly doesn’t cover all of the technology used by your particular employer. Although <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch_kubernetes">Chapter 7</a> discusses Kubernetes, a technology for orchestrating the deployments of application code, your employer may instead use a different solution like Apache Mesos. Or perhaps you rely on a version of Kubernetes in a cloud environment where the underlying implementation is hidden from you. At any rate, by learning about tools in the different layers of a distributed backend service stack, you’ll more easily understand other technology stacks that you may encounter.</p>&#13;
