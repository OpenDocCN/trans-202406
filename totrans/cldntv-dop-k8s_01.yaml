- en: Kubernetes is a real industry revolution. Just a brief look at the Cloud Native
    Computing Foundation’s [Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io), which contains
    data about more than six hundred projects that exist in the cloud native world
    today, highlights the importance of Kubernetes these days. Not all these tools
    were developed for Kubernetes, not all of them can even be used with Kubernetes,
    but all of them are part of the huge ecosystem where Kubernetes is one of the
    flagship technologies.

- en: Kubernetes changed the way applications are developed and operated. It’s a core
    component in the DevOps world today. Kubernetes brings flexibility to developers
    and freedom to operations. Today you can use Kubernetes on any major cloud provider,
    on bare-metal on-premises environments, as well as on a local developer’s machine.
    Stability, flexibility, a powerful API, open code, and an open developer community
    are a few reasons why Kubernetes became an industry standard, just as Linux is
    a standard in the world of operating systems.

- en: '*Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes* is a great handbook for people who are
    performing their day-to-day activities with Kubernetes or are just starting their
    Kubernetes journey. John and Justin cover all the major aspects of deploying,
    configuring, and operating Kubernetes and the best practices for developing and
    running applications on it. They also give a great overview of the related technologies,
    including Prometheus, Helm, and continuous deployment. This is a must-read book
    for everyone in the DevOps world.'

- en: Kubernetes is not just yet another exciting tool; it is an industry standard
    and the foundation for next-generation technologies including serverless (OpenFaaS,
    Knative) and machine learning (Kubeflow) tools. The entire IT industry is changing
    because of the cloud native revolution, and it’s hugely exciting to be living
    through it.
