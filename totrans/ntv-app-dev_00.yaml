  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is a practical cross-reference for iOS and Android native development.
    By “native” we mean the original, provided toolsets for each platform—Swift and
    Cocoa for iOS, and Java or Kotlin with the Android Open Source Project (AOSP)
    software development kit (SDK) for Android.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We were motivated to write this book out of common need. Both authors have experience
    with both platforms but specialize in one. Members of our team (including ourselves)
    would find themselves working on a problem we encountered in one platform, determine
    a solution to that problem in that platform, and then need to share that solution
    with the team members working on the other platform.

- en: Often, these were common tasks like reading or writing to or from a database
    or files, making a network connection, or showing user feedback in a way that’s
    familiar to users. When we started codifying and documenting these tasks, in both
    platforms, it quickly became apparent that a very large majority of application
    code fell into one of these categorizations and that a reference source for all
    of them could be valuable to teams with a similar makeup, teams starting a transition
    to another platform, or even developers who wanted to start learning both platforms
    at the same time.

    development tasks to its readers.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having an entire team of mobile developers with varying levels of cross-platform
    experience, we were able to manage this pretty well, but the idea of a cross-reference
    came up a lot, yet there’s really nothing currently available that provides the
    breadth we think is necessary. We could only imagine the frustration a sole developer
    in the same situation might experience; this book allows anyone to learn the basic
    approach to most of the common tasks in application development for both platforms.
    Each task chapter shows the entire process for the task in both Android and iOS
    with human-readable walk-throughs of the code samples. We would posit that the
    samples cover 80% of the basic knowledge required to start off in app development;
    of course the reader is expected to maintain and update their knowledge and read
    documentation for what we don’t specifically cover, but we’ve included a start-to-finish
    application walk-through as well. This sample app demonstrates how to successfully
    accomplish virtually everything needed by a modern app, using the task cross-reference
    provided earlier.

- en: Since all Android code examples are provided in both Java and Kotlin, this book
    has a pleasant side effect of allowing Android developers the same type of cross-reference
    between Java and Kotlin as cross-platform developers enjoy between iOS and AOSP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The code samples are not pseudo-code; they are written in the suggested languages
    and should all compile and function as described.

- en: Who This Book Is For
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for any native programmer working either exclusively with a single
    platform or with both, or familiar with one but needing to have some ability with
    the other. We assume at least a passing familiarity with some programming language.
    You don’t have to be an expert with Java or Swift, but having some UI programming
    background is helpful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You may need to refer to official documentation for Objective-C, Swift, Java,
    or Kotlin to understand some basic language mechanics referenced within this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Programmers coming from one framework (iOS- or Android-native development) should
    have an especially easy time consuming the information provided because almost
    all code examples are presented with functional equivalence in the complimentary
    framework (Android for iOS, and vice versa).

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is divided into two parts, excluding front and back matter. The first
    part is a list of common, platform-agnostic tasks, like writing a file to local
    storage or creating an HTTP request. The second part walks you through creating
    a bare-bones app in each platform, utilizing the techniques from [Part I](part01.html#part_1_tasks).
