<h1>Just Another Packet</h1>

<p>Since the first two computers were joined together over a cable, networking has been a crucial part of our infrastructure.
Networks now have layers and layers of complexity to support a multitude of use cases, and the advent of containers and projects like Mesosphere and Kubernetes have not changed that. While the contributors of Kubernetes have attempted to abstract away this networking complexity for developers, computer science is just that, abstraction upon abstraction. Kubernetes, and its networking API, is another abstraction that makes it easier and faster to deploy applications for consumption. What about the administrator who has to manage Kubernetes? This book intends to dispel
the mysticism around the abstractions Kubernetes puts in place, guide administrators through the layers of complexity,
and help you realize Kubernetes is not just another packet.</p>

<h1>Who This Book Is For</h1>

<p>According to <a href="https://oreil.ly/2SlsD">451 Research</a>, the global application container market is expected to grow from USD 2.1 billion in 2019 to USD 4.2 billion by 2022 . This explosive growth in the
container market underscores the need for IT professionals to be knowledgeable in deploying, managing, and troubleshooting 
<span class="keep-together">containers.</span></p>

<p>This book is intended to be read from beginning to end by new network, Linux, or cluster administrators, and it can be used by more experienced DevOps engineers to jump to specific topics for
which they find themselves needing to be upskilled. Network, Linux, and cluster administrators need to be familiar with how to operate Kubernetes at scale.</p>

<p>In this book, readers will find the information required to navigate the layers of complexity that come with running a Kubernetes network. This book will peel back the abstractions that Kubernetes puts in place so that developers have a similar experience across deployments on-premises, in the cloud, and with managed services. 
<span class="keep-together">Engineers</span> responsible for production cluster operations and network uptime can use this book to bridge the gap in their knowledge of those abstractions.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="What You Will Learn"><div class="sect1" id="idm46219958193144">
<h1>What You Will Learn</h1>

<p>By the end of this book, the reader will understand the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Kubernetes networking model</li>
    <li>The Container Network Interface (CNI) project and how to choose a CNI project for their clusters</li>
    <li>Networking and Linux primitives that power Kubernetes</li>
    <li>The relationship between the abstractions powering the Kubernetes network</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the reader will be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Deploy and manage a production-scale network for Kubernetes clusters</li>
    <li>Troubleshoot underlying network-related application issues inside a Kubernetes cluster</li>
</ul>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>The authors would like to thank the team at O’Reilly Media for helping them through the process of writing their first book. Melissa Potter was instrumental in getting this across the finish line. We would also like to recognize Thomas Behnken for aiding us with his Azure expertise.</p>

<p><strong>James</strong>: Karen, thank you for all your faith in me and for helping him believe in himself even when he didn’t. Wink, you are the reason I started working in this field, and I am forever grateful.  Ann, I have come a long way since learning English is supposed to be capitalized.  James would also like to thank all the other teachers and coaches in his life who supported him.</p>

<p><strong>Vallery</strong>: I’d like to thank the friendly faces in SIG-Network for helping me get started in upstream Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Finally, the authors would like to thank the Kubernetes community; this book wouldn’t exist without them. We hope it helps further the knowledge for all engineers looking to adopt Kubernetes.</p>
