    every kind of application that you might want to deploy you can fit within Kubernetes,
    and no matter what kind of adjustments or tuning you need to make to your system,
    they’re generally possible.

    reasonable amount of complexity. Understanding how the APIs and components of
    Kubernetes work is critical to successfully unlocking the power of Kubernetes
    to make your application development, management, and deployment easier and more
    reliable.
