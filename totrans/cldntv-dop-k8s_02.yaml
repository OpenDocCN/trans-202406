- en: In the world of IT operations, the key principles of DevOps have become well
    understood and widely adopted, but now the landscape is changing. A new application
    platform called Kubernetes has become rapidly adopted by companies all over the
    world and in all kinds of different industries. As more and more applications
    and businesses move from traditional servers to the Kubernetes environment, people
    are asking how to do DevOps in this new world.

- en: This book explains what DevOps means in a cloud native world where Kubernetes
    is the standard platform. It will help you select the best tools and frameworks
    from the Kubernetes ecosystem. It will also present a coherent way to use those
    tools and frameworks, offering battle-tested solutions that are running right
    now, in production, for real.

- en: You’ll learn what Kubernetes is, where it comes from, and what it means for
    the future of software development and operations. You’ll learn how containers
    work, how to build and manage them, and how to design cloud native services and
    infrastructure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll understand the trade-offs between building and hosting Kubernetes clusters
    yourself, and using managed services. You’ll learn the capabilities, limitations,
    and pros and cons of popular Kubernetes installation tools such as kops and kubeadm.
    You’ll get an informed overview of the major managed Kubernetes offerings from
    the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll get hands-on practical experience of writing and deploying Kubernetes
    applications, configuring and operating Kubernetes clusters, and automating cloud
    infrastructure and deployments with tools like Helm. You’ll learn about Kubernetes
    support for security, authentication, and permissions, including Role-Based Access
    Control (RBAC), and best practices for securing containers and Kubernetes in production.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll learn how to set up continuous integration and deployment with Kubernetes;
    a bit about GitOps; how to back up and restore data; how to test your cluster
    for conformance and reliability; how to monitor, trace, log, and aggregate metrics;
    and how to make your Kubernetes infrastructure scalable, resilient, and cost-effective.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is most directly relevant to IT operations staff responsible for servers,
    applications, and services, and developers responsible for either building new
    cloud native services or migrating existing applications to Kubernetes and cloud.
    We assume no prior knowledge of Kubernetes or containers—don’t worry, we’ll walk
    you through all that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Experienced Kubernetes users should still find much valuable material in the
    book: it covers advanced topics such as RBAC, continuous deployment, secrets management,
    and observability. Whatever your level of expertise, we hope you’ll find something
    useful in these pages.'

- en: 'In planning and writing this book, we spoke to hundreds of people about cloud
    native and Kubernetes, ranging from industry leaders and experts to complete beginners.
    Here are some of the questions they said they wanted a book like this to answer:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I’d like to learn why I should invest my time in this technology. What problems
    will it help to solve for me and my team?”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Kubernetes seems great, but it’s quite a steep learning curve. Setting up a
    quick demo is easy, but operating and troubleshooting it seems daunting. We’d
    like some solid guidance on how people are running Kubernetes clusters in the
    real world, and what problems we’re likely to encounter.”
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Opinionated advice would be useful. The Kubernetes ecosystem has too many options
    for beginning teams to choose between. When there are multiple ways of doing the
    same thing, which one is best? How do we choose?”
  prefs:

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How do I use Kubernetes without breaking my company?”
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We kept these questions, and many others, firmly in mind while writing this
    book, and we’ve done our level best to answer them. How did we do? Keep reading
    to find out.
