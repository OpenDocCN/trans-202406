      <p>In this chapter, we’ll expand on Azure Arc, shifting specifically to how it can be used for managing Kubernetes across multiple clouds. </p>

        <h1>What Is Azure Kubernetes Service? </h1>
        <p>It’s no secret that containers and Kubernetes have exploded in tech. As the growth of containers within companies continues to increase, so does the number of containers companies need to manage. </p>
        <p>Many companies come to a point where they need a way to efficiently manage and orchestrate containers. Google released Kubernetes as an open source orchestration system for containers, and companies have adopted it at such a fast rate that it has become the go-to for container orchestration. Along with the rise of Kubernetes in the enterprise, major cloud providers have created managed Kubernetes offerings on their cloud platforms. Microsoft has created Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on the Azure cloud platform.</p>
        <p>Before we get into Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes, it’s important to talk about AKS and what it is. When Kubernetes clusters are projected into Azure Arc, they have some similar functionality to AKS, such as monitoring, Azure Policy, and so on. This means that the experience of getting information from and administering Kubernetes is simplified. </p>
        <p>AKS is a managed Kubernetes offering from Microsoft on the Azure cloud platform and was launched in 2018. It reduces the management overhead of running your own Kubernetes cluster instance. With AKS, you only need to administer the agent nodes, as Microsoft manages the Control Plane for you. You get integration with many native Azure services, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Azure Networking</p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Active Directory for RBAC </p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Policy</p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Monitor for Kubernetes and container monitoring </p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Container Registry</p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Security Center</p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Defender</p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Storage</p></li>
          <li><p>Azure Container Instances</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>With AKS, Microsoft has and continues to deliver innovation at a super-fast pace. Some of the additions Microsoft has added to AKS to make the Kubernetes experience easier and enhanced include Kubernetes resources for viewing/managing Kubernetes API objects—such pods, services, namespaces, and so on—right in the Azure portal; Dev Spaces for easier client-side integration with Visual Studio and VS Code for developers to develop on Kubernetes clusters; and use of managed identities for a more secure, hands-off approach to a service account for your Kubernetes cluster. </p>

        <h1>Azure Arc Enabled Kubernetes</h1>
        <p>As we discussed previously, many organizations have moved to multicloud. We also discussed how managing resources and workloads across many environments and clouds is a challenge. Kubernetes is often billed as a technology that can help companies avoid vendor lock-in and that provides agility to move between clouds. </p>
        <p>While it is true that containerized workloads running on Kubernetes are portable, making it easier to run these across on-premises or clouds, doing so and even managing specific configurations and workloads across multiple clouds is still a hefty challenge for organizations and their IT teams. </p>
        <p>With Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes, Microsoft has set out to make the challenge of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters—regardless of where they’re running—a much smaller headache and to streamline the process. Azure Arc not only mixes and matches cloud and VMs, but it also allows you to mix and match Kubernetes clusters. At the time of this writing, Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes is in public preview and is only supported in the Eastern US and Western Europe regions. It will be supported in more regions when it releases to general availability. </p>
        <p>In a nutshell, Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes allows customers to connect Azure to Kubernetes clusters that are running either on-premises or on other cloud providers for a unified management experience within the Azure cloud platform. It supports most out-of-the-box Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)–certified Kubernetes distributions. <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_1_kubernetes_clusters_across_multiple_clouds_managed">Figure 2-1</a> shows the various managed Kubernetes cloud offerings that can be managed with Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes. </p>

        <p>With Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes, we can accomplish the <span class="keep-together">following</span>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Utilize Azure Active Directory RBAC for access to Kubernetes clusters. </p></li>
          <li><p>Inventory, group, and tag Kubernetes clusters running in Azure or non-Azure environments and clouds. </p></li>
          <li><p>Utilize Azure Monitor to monitor both Kubernetes clusters and containers. </p></li>
          <li><p>Utilize Azure Policies for governance of Kubernetes clusters via applying Azure Policies. </p></li>
          <li><p>Deploy applications using either Kubernetes manifests or Helm Charts along with configurations via GitOps. </p></li>
        </ul>
