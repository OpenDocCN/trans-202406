  <h1>Foreword</h1>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  There is so much you need to understand as a web developer to build&#13;
  applications that users will love. In the React space in particular,&#13;
  there’s a wealth of material available to you, and that’s part of the&#13;
  problem. Not all of it is consistent, and you have to make your own path wading&#13;
  through all of the tutorials and blog posts available, hoping you’ll piece&#13;
  together a curriculum that is free of contradictions and won’t leave&#13;
  gaping holes in your knowledge. And you’ll always worry that what&#13;
  you’re learning is out of date.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  This is where Tejas Kumar comes in with this book. Tejas has had years of&#13;
  React experience and has gone to great lengths to go in depth on topics that&#13;
  will give you a solid foundation of knowledge. He’s an experienced&#13;
  engineer and fountain of knowledge that will help you feel confident with&#13;
  React. I have been blessed to associate with Tejas over the years in various&#13;
  capacities in open source, conference speaking, educational content creation,&#13;
  and on a personal level, and I hope you understand you hold in your hand a book&#13;
  that has been crafted by a talented individual who is also a fantastic person.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  In this book, you’ll dive into subjects you would likely not otherwise be&#13;
  exposed to that will help you “think in React” with the proper&#13;
  mental model. You’ll come to understand the purpose of React’s&#13;
  existence in the first place, which will give you a good frame of reference&#13;
  when considering React as a tool to solve problems. React wasn’t invented&#13;
  in a vacuum, and understanding the origin story will help you know the&#13;
  problems React is intended to solve so you can avoid putting a round peg in a&#13;
  square hole.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  You will understand foundational concepts like JSX, the virtual DOM,&#13;
  reconciliation, and concurrent React, which will help you use this tool more&#13;
  efficiently. I’ve always believed that the best way to level up your&#13;
  experience with a tool is to understand how the tool works. So even if&#13;
  you’ve been using React for years at this point, these sections will open&#13;
  your mind to new possibilities and understanding as you come to really&#13;
  <em>understand</em> React, rather than just piecing things together and&#13;
  hoping (fingers crossed) the result is positive.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  You’ll discover patterns that the pros use to build effective and powerful&#13;
  abstractions. React itself is a very fast UI library, but there are times when&#13;
  you’re building complex applications that you’ll need to reach for&#13;
  performance optimizations, and Tejas will show you how with the memoization,&#13;
  lazy loading, and state management techniques available in React. Beyond that,&#13;
  you’ll understand how the best libraries in the ecosystem work with&#13;
  patterns like compound components, render props, prop getters, state reducers,&#13;
  and control props. These are critical tools in your tool belt as you build&#13;
  React applications. Even if you’re just using off-the-shelf solutions,&#13;
  understanding how those powerful abstractions work will help you use them more&#13;
  effectively.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  Tejas goes beyond theoretical React though, and you’ll be introduced to&#13;
  practical frameworks like Remix and Next.js that will be important for you to&#13;
  take advantage of React’s full stack capabilities to make the&#13;
  best user experience possible. With React’s server rendering capabilities&#13;
  since the beginning, you can take control of your own destiny as you use React&#13;
  to build your entire user experience on both the frontend and the backend. And&#13;
  you’ll also get to know the leading edge tech, like Server Components and&#13;
  Server Actions, that React is using to level up the user experience.&#13;
</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
  I’m confident that after reading what Tejas has put together for you,&#13;
  you’ll have the knowledge you need to be successful at building&#13;
  exceptional applications with React. I wish you the very best on your learning&#13;
  experience with React, the most widely used UI library in the world. Enjoy the&#13;
  journey!&#13;
