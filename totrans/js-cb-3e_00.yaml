- en: As I sat down to work on the latest edition of *JavaScript Cookbook*, I considered
    the “cookbook” metaphor carefully. What makes a great food cookbook? Browsing
    the cookbooks on a shelf in my dining room, I noted that my favorites not only
    have delicious recipes, but they are also full of opinionated hard-earned advice.
    A cookbook rarely seeks to teach you *every* recipe for beef bourguignon; rather
    it teaches you the technique and recipe that the author has found works best for
    them, typically with a bit of advice thrown in for good measure. It’s with this
    concept in mind that we put together this collection of JavaScript recipes. The
    advice in this book comes from three seasoned pros, but it is ultimately the culmination
    of *our* unique experiences. Any other group of developers would have likely produced
    a similar, but different book.

    language. With this collection in hand you will be able to solve all sorts of
    problems that you encounter and may even begin to develop recipes of your own.

- en: 'To encompass the many subjects and topics reflective of JavaScript in use today,
    we had to start with one premise: this is not a book for someone brand new to
    programming. There are so many good books and tutorials for those looking to learn
    to program with JavaScript that we felt comfortable targeting the *practicing
    developer*, someone looking to solve specific problems and challenges with JavaScript.'

- en: If you’ve been playing around with JavaScript for several months, maybe tried
    your hand with a little Node or web development, you should be comfortable with
    the book material. Additionally, if you’re a developer who primarily works in
    another programming language, but find yourself needing to use JavaScript from
    time to time, this should be a helpful guide. Finally, if you’re a working JavaScript
    developer who sometimes gets stuck on some of the idiosyncrasies of the language,
    this should act as a useful resource.

    second is someone who dips their toes in as needed, seeking out the solution to
    a specific challenge or category of problem that they face. We attempted to organize
    the book in such a way that it would be useful to both types of readers, organizing

    were written by Shelley Powers. This edition was written and updated by Adam Scott
    and Matthew MacDonald. Adam and Matthew would like to thank their editors, Angela
    Rufino and Jennifer Pollock, who shepherded the project through all its growing
    pains; and their top-shelf tech reviewers, Sarah Wachs, Schalk Neethling, and
    Elisabeth Robson, who offered many sharp insights and helpful suggestions. Adam
    would also like to thank John Paxton for his support and conversation during the
    early drafts of this edition.
