- en: Kubernetes is a complete container orchestration platform, allowing engineers
    to run a fleet of containers across multiple machines. Minikube is a simplified
    version that makes the process of running it locally on a single machine easier.
    The official Kubernetes docs maintain an [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
    page with installation instructions, but installation instructions have been repeated
    here for your reference.

    To enable it, launch the Docker Desktop tool by clicking the Docker icon in your
    menu bar and then clicking the Preferences option. In the screen that comes up,
    click the Kubernetes tab. Finally, click the Enable Kubernetes checkbox and then
    click Apply & Restart. It may take a couple of minutes, but the UI should update
    and say that Kubernetes is running.
