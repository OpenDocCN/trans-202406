    of the foundational elements of sustainable devops cultures described in our book,

    foundations of effective collaboration—trust, empathy, and psychological safety—and
    to show you how to weave these principles into your company culture. Individuals
    who feel empowered and motivated to adopt the processes, practices, and tools
    necessary for healthy working relationships can help drive innovation. The efforts
    you make to promote collaboration within your company and to reward the individuals
    who embody collaboration principles will result in empowered employees, more productive
    teams, and a respectful workplace that people want to contribute to and continually
    improve.'

- en: There is no single definition of “devops.” Most agree that devops involves elements
    of people, processes, and technology organized in a way to help teams work well
    together to improve software creation and delivery. Many people think about devops
    as specific tools like Docker or Kubernetes, but devops is not about tools alone.
    Neither is it solely about specific practices like continuous deployment (CD)
    or continuous integration (CI). What makes tools and practices “devops” is how
    they are used, not just the characteristics of those tools or practices.

- en: We define devops as a way of thinking and a way of working. Specifically, it
    is a framework for sharing stories and developing empathy, enabling people and
    teams to practice their crafts in effective and lasting ways. It is part of the
    cultural weave of values, norms, knowledge, technology, tools, and practices that
    shape how we work and why.

- en: We have had many discussions over the capitalization (or lack thereof) of the
    term “devops.” A simple online poll showed overwhelming support for “DevOps.”
    We also found a varying focus on the “Dev” and “Ops” within different organizations.
    This has led to the creation of terms like “DevSecOps” and “DevQAOps,” as “DevOps”
    implies exclusively “Dev” and “Ops.”

- en: Ultimately, this is why we’ve chosen to style this word as “devops”—it reflects
    the original Twitter hashtag used to connect people wanting to help change conversations
    from “us versus them” to “enabling the business” with sustainable work practices
    that focus on people.

- en: Successful projects require input, effort, insight, and collaboration from people
    across the organization; the problems inherent in your organization may not be
    limited to just developers and operations teams. We have deliberately chosen to
    use lowercase “devops” throughout the text of this book to reflect our view that
    this is an inclusive movement, not an exclusive one.

- en: Collaboration is the practice of multiple individuals working together, building
    toward a specific outcome. Effective collaboration within the enterprise isn’t
    like a school project gone awry in which one person dominates everyone else’s
    efforts, ignoring other people’s inputs and opinions in pursuit of their own good
    grade. It also isn’t about some people picking up the slack for others who have
    checked out. Instead, it’s about people coming together from different perspectives,
    and everyone providing input so that you can come to a shared understanding with
    a collective team perspective. Collaboration is about building trust, empathy,
    and team psychological safety in an environment that often requires you to work
    with many people for short periods of time to get work done.

- en: Software development and operations teams working together is a core part of
    the devops movement.^([1](preface01.xhtml#idm45727904062104)) Before one team
    can successfully work with another team that has a different focus, the individuals
    on both teams need to be able to work with each other. Teams that don’t work well
    on an individual or intrateam level have little hope of working well at the interteam
    level.

- en: In this book, you’ll learn about the building blocks of collaborative relationships
    and how to promote them in the workplace and apply them to your teams. We offer
    tips on improving communication within and between teams to strengthen your working
    relationships. And finally, we show you how to apply collaboration principles
    to different stages of the software development life cycle. This is not an exhaustive
    set of recommendations; our aim is to give you ideas and advice that you can begin
    applying in your organization today to improve team productivity, increase the
    frequency and quality of software deliveries, and focus more time on innovation.
