<h1>Who Should Read This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Kubernetes is the de facto standard for cloud native development. It is a&#13;
powerful tool that can make your next application easier to develop,&#13;
faster to deploy, and more reliable to operate. However, unlocking the&#13;
power of Kubernetes requires using it correctly. This book is&#13;
intended for anyone who is deploying real-world applications to Kubernetes&#13;
and is interested in learning patterns and practices they can apply&#13;
to the applications that they build on top of Kubernetes.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Importantly, this book is not an introduction to Kubernetes. We assume&#13;
that you have a basic familiarity with the Kubernetes API and tools,&#13;
and that you know how to create and interact with a Kubernetes cluster.&#13;
If you are looking to learn Kubernetes, there are numerous great resources&#13;
out there, such as <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/ziNRK"><em>Kubernetes: Up and Running</em></a> (O’Reilly), that can give you an&#13;
introduction.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Instead, this book is a resource for anyone who wants to dive deep on&#13;
how to deploy specific applications and workloads on Kubernetes. It&#13;
should be useful to you whether you are about to deploy your first&#13;
application onto Kubernetes or you’ve been using Kubernetes for&#13;
years.</p>&#13;

<h1>Why We Wrote This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Between the four of us, we have significant experience helping a wide&#13;
variety of users deploy their applications onto Kubernetes. Through this&#13;
experience, we have seen where people struggle, and we have helped them&#13;
find their way to success. When sitting down to write this book, we&#13;
attempted to capture these experiences so that many more people could&#13;
learn by reading the lessons that we learned from these real-world&#13;
experiences. It’s our hope that by committing our experiences to writing,&#13;
we can scale our knowledge and allow you to be successful deploying&#13;
and managing your application on Kubernetes on your own.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Navigating This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id337">&#13;
<h1>Navigating This Book</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Although you might read this book from cover to cover in a single&#13;
sitting, that is not really how we intended you to use it. Instead,&#13;
we designed this book to be a collection of standalone chapters.&#13;
Each chapter gives a complete overview of a particular task that you&#13;
might need to accomplish with Kubernetes. We expect people to dive&#13;
into the book to learn about a specific topic or interest, and then leave the book alone, only to return when a new topic comes up.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Despite this standalone approach, some themes span the book. There are several chapters on developing applications on Kubernetes. <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#developer_workflows">Chapter 2</a> covers developer workflows. <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.html#continuous_integration_testing_and_deployment">Chapter 5</a> discusses continuous integration and testing. <a data-type="xref" href="ch15.html#building_higher_level_application_patterns_on_kubernetes">Chapter 15</a> covers building higher-level platforms on top of Kubernetes, and <a data-type="xref" href="ch16.html#managing_state_and_stateful_application">Chapter 16</a> discusses managing state and stateful applications. In addition to developing applications, there are several chapters on operating services in Kubernetes. <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.html#setting_up_a_basic_service">Chapter 1</a> covers the setup of a basic service, and <a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#monitoring_and_logging_in_kubernetes">Chapter 3</a> covers monitoring&#13;
and metrics. <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#configuration_secrets_and_rbac">Chapter 4</a> covers configuration management, while <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#versioning_releases_and_rollouts">Chapter 6</a> covers versioning and releases. <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#worldwide_application_distribution_and_staging">Chapter 7</a> covers deploying your application around the world.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>There are also several chapters on cluster management, including&#13;
<a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#resource_management">Chapter 8</a> on resource management, <a data-type="xref" href="ch09.html#networking_network_security_and_service_mesh">Chapter 9</a> on networking, <a data-type="xref" href="ch10.html#pod_and_container_security">Chapter 10</a> on pod security, <a data-type="xref" href="ch11.html#policy_and_governance_for_your_cluster">Chapter 11</a> on policy and governance, <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#managing_multiple_clusters">Chapter 12</a> on managing multiple clusters, and <a data-type="xref" href="ch17.html#admission_control_and_authorization">Chapter 17</a> on admission control and authorization. Finally, some chapters are truly independent; these cover machine learning (<a data-type="xref" href="ch14.html#running_machine_learning_in_kubernetes">Chapter 14</a>) and integrating with external services (<a data-type="xref" href="ch13.html#integrating_external_services_and_kubernetes">Chapter 13</a>).</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Though it can be useful to read all the chapters before you actually attempt the topic in the real world, our primary hope is that you will treat this book as a reference. It is intended as a guide as you put these topics to practice in the real world.</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="New to This Edition" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id338">&#13;
<h1>New to This Edition</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We wanted to complement the 1st edition with four new chapters that cover emerging tools and patterns as Kubernetes continues to mature and provide best practices. These new chapters are <a data-type="xref" href="ch18.html#gitops">Chapter 18</a> on GitOps, <a data-type="xref" href="ch19.html#security">Chapter 19</a> on security, <a data-type="xref" href="ch20.html#chaos_testing_load_testing_experiments">Chapter 20</a> on chaos testing, and <a data-type="xref" href="ch21.html#implementing_an_operator">Chapter 21</a> on implementing an operator.</p>&#13;
