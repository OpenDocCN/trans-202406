    assume you’re using a terminal. If you’re not friends with your terminal, I highly
    recommend you spend some time familiarizing yourself with your terminal of choice.
    Many of the utilities in this book have corresponding GUI interfaces, so if you’re

    is ubiquity. Sit down in front of any Unix-based computer, and 99% of the time,
    the default shell will be bash.

    been particularly interested in providing a pleasant terminal experience, so you’ll
    have to do a little more work. Git helpfully includes a “Git bash” shell, which
    provides a Unix-like terminal experience (it has only a small subset of the normally
    available Unix command-line utilities, but it’s a useful subset). While Git bash
    provides you with a minimal bash shell, it’s still using the built-in Windows
    console application, which leads to an exercise in frustration (even simple functionality
    like resizing a console window, selecting text, cutting, and pasting is unintuitive
    and awkward). For this reason, I recommend installing a more sophisticated terminal
    such as [ConsoleZ](https://github.com/cbucher/console) or [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io).
    For Windows power users—especially for .NET developers or for hardcore Windows
    systems or network administrators—there is another option: Microsoft’s own PowerShell.
    PowerShell lives up to its name: people do remarkable things with it, and a skilled
    PowerShell user could give a Unix command-line guru a run for their money. However,
    if you move between macOS/Linux and Windows, I still recommend sticking with Git
    bash for the consistency it provides.'

    you’ll save yourself a lot of headaches later by learning a little now. At minimum,

    break out of a command-line program (usually Ctrl-C). If you want to become a
