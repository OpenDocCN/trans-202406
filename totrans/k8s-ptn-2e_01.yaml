    the way we design, develop, and run software has changed radically. Today’s applications
    are optimized for availability, scalability, and speed-to-market. Driven by these
    new requirements, today’s modern applications require a different set of patterns
    and practices. This book aims to help developers discover and learn about the
    most common patterns for creating cloud native applications with Kubernetes. First,
    let’s take a brief look at the two primary ingredients of this book: Kubernetes
    and design patterns.'

- en: '*Kubernetes* is a container orchestration platform. The origin of Kubernetes
    lies somewhere in the Google data centers where Google’s internal container orchestration
    platform, [Borg](https://oreil.ly/x12HH), was born. Google used Borg for many
    years to run its applications. In 2014, Google decided to transfer its experience
    with Borg into a new open source project called “Kubernetes” (Greek for “helmsman”
    or “pilot”). In 2015, it became the first project donated to the newly founded
    Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).'

    of contributors grew incredibly fast. Today, Kubernetes is considered one of the
    most popular projects on GitHub. It is fair to claim that Kubernetes is the most
    commonly used and feature-rich container orchestration platform. Kubernetes also
    forms the foundation of other platforms built on top of it. The most prominent
    of those Platform-as-a-Service systems is Red Hat OpenShift, which provides various
    additional capabilities to Kubernetes. These are only some reasons we chose Kubernetes
    as the reference platform for the cloud native patterns in this book.

    we recapitulate the core Kubernetes concepts and lay the foundation for the following
    patterns.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The concept of *design patterns* dates back to the 1970s and is from the field
    of architecture. Christopher Alexander, an architect and system theorist, and
    his team published the groundbreaking [*A Pattern Language*](https://oreil.ly/TKzwz)
    (Oxford University Press) in 1977, which describes architectural patterns for
    creating towns, buildings, and other construction projects. Sometime later, this
    idea was adopted by the newly formed software industry. The most famous book in
    this area is [*Design Patterns—Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*](https://oreil.ly/k5toF)
    by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides—the Gang of Four
    (Addison-Wesley). When we talk about the famous Singleton, Factories, or Delegation
    patterns, it’s because of this defining work. Many other great pattern books have
    been written since then for various fields with different levels of granularity,
    like *[Enterprise Integration Patterns](https://oreil.ly/5aRjR)* by Gregor Hohpe
    and Bobby Woolf (Addison-Wesley) or [*Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture*](https://oreil.ly/yOdWA)
    by Martin Fowler (Addison-Wesley).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In short, a *pattern* describes a *repeatable solution to a problem*.^([1](preface01.html#idm45902099359264))
    This definition works for the patterns we describe in this book, except that we
    probably don’t have as much variability in our solutions. A pattern is different
    from a recipe because instead of giving step-by-step instructions to solve a problem,
    it provides a blueprint for solving a whole class of similar problems. For example,
    the Alexandrian pattern *Beer Hall* describes how public drinking halls should
    be constructed where “strangers and friends are drinking companions” and not “anchors
    of the lonely.” All halls built after this pattern look different but share common
    characteristics, such as open alcoves for groups of four to eight and a place
    where a hundred people can meet to enjoy beverages, music, and other activities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, a pattern does more than provide a solution. It is also about forming
    a language. The patterns in this book form a dense, noun-centric language in which
    each pattern carries a unique *name*. When this language is established, these
    names automatically evoke similar mental representations when people speak about
    these patterns. For example, when we talk about a table, anyone speaking English
    assumes we are talking about a piece of wood with four legs and a top on which
    you can put things. The same thing happens in software engineering when discussing
    a “factory.” In an object-oriented programming language context, we immediately
    associate with a “factory” an object that produces other objects. Because we immediately
    know the solution behind the pattern, we can move on to tackle yet-unsolved problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are also other characteristics of a pattern language. For example, patterns
    are interconnected and can overlap so that they cover most of the problem space.
    Also, as already laid out in the original *A Pattern Language*, patterns have
    a different level of granularity and scope. More general patterns cover an extensive
    problem space and provide rough guidance on how to solve the problem. Granular
    patterns have a very concrete solution proposal but are less widely applicable.
    This book contains all sorts of patterns, and many patterns reference other patterns
    or may even include other patterns as part of the solution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another feature of patterns is that they follow a rigid format. However, each
    author defines a different form; unfortunately, there is no common standard for
    how patterns should be laid out. Martin Fowler gives an excellent overview of
    the formats used for pattern languages at [“Writing Software Patterns”](https://oreil.ly/6IA6k).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for *developers* who want to design and develop cloud native applications
    and use Kubernetes as the platform. It is most suitable for readers who have some
    basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts and want to take it
    to the next level. However, you don’t need to know the low-level details of Kubernetes
    to understand the use cases and patterns. Architects, consultants, and other technical
    personnel will also benefit from the repeatable patterns described here.

    It is an accumulation of best practices and patterns after years of working in
    this space. We want to help you understand the Kubernetes-first mindset and create
    better cloud native applications—not reinvent the wheel. It is written in a relaxed
    style and is similar to a series of essays that can be read independently.

    patterns are presented from a conceptual angle not found in other books on the
    topic. Other patterns are explained with detailed steps to solve a concrete problem,
    as in [Part IV, “Configuration Patterns”](part04.html#part_configuration). In
    some chapters, we explain Kubernetes features that don’t fit nicely into a pattern
    definition. Don’t get hung up on whether it is a pattern or a feature. In all

    the use cases, lessons learned, and best practices. That is the valuable part.
