- en: As engineers, we may run into situations when we are on a deadline to deliver
    a solution or where code gets included as a series of patches without a code review.
    The code in such cases may not always be well thought out and may propagate what
    we call *anti-patterns*. This chapter describes what anti-patterns are and why
    it is essential to understand and identify them. We also look at some typical
    anti-patterns in JavaScript.

    learned when a proposed pattern goes wrong. Inspired by the GoF’s book *Design
    Patterns*, Andrew Koenig first coined the term anti-pattern in 1995 in his article
    in the [*Journal of Object-Oriented Programming*, Volume 8](https://oreil.ly/Megyr).

    Let us qualify the reason behind this. When creating an application, a project’s
    lifecycle begins with construction. At this stage, you are likely to choose from
    the available *good* design patterns as you see fit. However, after the initial
    release, it needs to be maintained.

- en: Maintenance of an application already in production can be particularly challenging.
    Developers who haven’t worked on the application before may accidentally introduce
    a *bad* design into the project. If these *bad* practices have already been identified
    as anti-patterns, developers will recognize them in advance and avoid the known
    common mistakes. This is similar to how knowledge of design patterns allows us
    to recognize areas where we could apply *known* and *helpful* standard techniques.

    on the skill level and time the team has invested in it. Here, *good* and *bad*
    are considered in context—a “perfect” design may qualify as an anti-pattern if
    applied in the wrong context.

    expedite code deliveries. These tend to become permanent and accumulate as technical
    debt that is essentially made up of anti-patterns. JavaScript is a weakly typed
    or untyped language that makes taking certain shortcuts easier. Following are
    some examples of anti-patterns that you might come across in JavaScript:'

  zh: 开发人员有时会明知故犯地选择捷径和临时解决方案以加快代码交付速度。这些往往会变成永久性问题，并积累为技术债务，其本质上由反模式组成。JavaScript是一种弱类型或无类型语言，这使得采取某些捷径更容易。以下是您可能在JavaScript中遇到的一些反模式示例：

- en: The use of `document.write` where native Document Object Model (DOM) alternatives
    such as `document.createElement` are more appropriate. `document.write` has been
    grossly misused over the years and has quite a few disadvantages. If it’s executed
    after the page has been loaded, it can overwrite the page we’re on, which makes
    `document.createElement` a far better choice. Visit [this link](https://oreil.ly/kc1c0)
    for a live example of this in action. It also doesn’t work with XHTML, which is
    another reason opting for more DOM-friendly methods such as `document.createElement`
    is favorable.

  zh: 在这里使用`document.write`，而原生文档对象模型（DOM）的替代方法如`document.createElement`更合适。多年来`document.write`被严重误用，并有许多缺点。如果在页面加载后执行，它可能会覆盖当前页面，因此选择`document.createElement`要明智得多。访问[此链接](https://oreil.ly/kc1c0)查看其实际应用的实时示例。它也不适用于XHTML，这是选择更友好的DOM方法如`document.createElement`的另一个原因。
