- en: The Kubernetes certification program has been around since 2018, or five years
    as of this writing. During this time, security has become more and more important
    everywhere, including the Kubernetes world. Recently, the role of [Certified Kubernetes
    Security Specialist (CKS)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cks) has been added
    to the certification track to address the need. Security can have different facets,
    and the way you address those concerns can be very diverse. That’s where the Kubernetes
    ecosystem comes into play. Apart from Kubernetes built-in security features, many
    tools have evolved that help with identifying and fixing security risks. As a
    Kubernetes administrator, you need to be familiar with the wide range of concepts
    and tools to harden your clusters and applications.

- en: The CKS certification program was created to verify competence on security-based
    topics, and it requires a successful pass of the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator
    (CKA)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka) exam before you can register. If
    you are completely new to the Kubernetes certification program, then I would recommend
    exploring the CKA or [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad)
    program first.

- en: In this study guide, I will explore the topics covered in the CKS exam to fully
    prepare you to pass the certification exam. We’ll look at determining when and
    how you should apply the core concepts of Kubernetes and external tooling to secure
    cluster components, cluster configuration, and applications running in a Pod.
    I will also offer tips to help you better prepare for the exam and share my personal
    experience with getting ready for all aspects of it.

- en: The CKS is different from the typical multiple-choice format of other certifications.
    It’s completely performance based and requires you to demonstrate deep knowledge
    of the tasks at hand under immense time pressure. Are you ready to pass the test
    on the first go?

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anyone who already passed the CKA exam and wants to broaden
    their knowledge in the realm of security. Given that you need to pass the CKA
    exam before signing up for the CKS, you should already be familiar with the format
    of the exam questions and environment. [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#exam-details-and-resources)
    only briefly recaps the general aspects of the exam curriculum, but it highlights
    the information specific to the CKS exam. If you have not taken the CKA exam yet,
    I recommend taking a step by reading the [*Certified Kubernetes Administrator
    (CKA) Study Guide*](https://oreil.ly/cka-study-guide) (O’Reilly). The book will
    provide you with the foundation you need to get started with the CKS.

- en: The content of the book condenses the most important aspects relevant to the
    CKS exam. Cloud-provider-specific Kubernetes implementations like AKS or GKE do
    not need to be considered. Given the plethora of configuration options available
    in Kubernetes, it’s almost impossible to cover all use cases and scenarios without
    duplicating the official documentation. Test takers are encouraged to reference
    the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home) as the go-to compendium
    for broader exposure. External tools relevant to the CKS exam, such as Trivy or
    Falco, are only covered on a high level. Refer to their documentation to explore
    more features, functionality, and configuration options.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The outline of the book follows the CKS curriculum to a T. While there might
    be a more natural, didactical structure for learning Kubernetes in general, the
    curriculum outline will help test takers prepare for the exam by focusing on specific
    topics. As a result, you will find yourself cross-referencing other chapters of
    the book depending on your existing knowledge level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be aware that this book covers only the concepts relevant to the CKS exam. Foundational
    Kubernetes concepts and primitives are not discussed. Refer to the Kubernetes
    documentation or other books if you want to dive deeper.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Practical experience with Kubernetes is key to passing the exam. Each chapter
    contains a section named “Sample Exercises” with practice questions. Solutions
    to those questions can be found in the [Appendix](app01.xhtml#appendix-a).

    the code manually if you are copy-pasting it directly from the book content to
    a terminal or editor. The better choice is to refer to the code book’s [GitHub
