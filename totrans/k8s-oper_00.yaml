- en: Kubernetes is a popular container orchestrator. It harnesses many computers
    together into one large computing resource and establishes a means of addressing
    that resource through the Kubernetes application programming interface (API).
    Kubernetes is open source software with origins at Google, developed over the
    last five years by a large group of collaborators under the auspices of the [Cloud
    Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/).

- en: An Operator extends Kubernetes to automate the management of the entire lifecycle
    of a particular application. Operators serve as a packaging mechanism for distributing
    applications on Kubernetes, and they monitor, maintain, recover, and upgrade the
    software they deploy.

- en: If you’ve deployed applications on a Kubernetes cluster, you’ll be familiar
    with some of the challenges and aspirations that forged the Operator pattern.
    If you’ve maintained foundation services like databases and filesystems in their
    own ghetto outside your orchestrated clusters, and you yearn to bring them into
    the neighborhood, this guide to Kubernetes Operators is for you.

- en: This book explains what an Operator is and how Operators extend the Kubernetes
    API. It shows how to deploy and use existing Operators, and how to create and
    distribute Operators for your applications using the [Red Hat Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework).
    We relate good practices for designing, building, and distributing Operators,
    and we explain the thinking that animates Operators with Site Reliability Engineering
    (SRE) principles.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After describing Operators and their concepts in the first chapter, we’ll suggest
    ways to get access to a Kubernetes cluster where you can do the exercises in the
    rest of the book. With a cluster running, you’ll deploy an Operator and observe
    its behavior when its application fails, scales, or gets upgraded to a new version.

    an Operator to naturalize an example application as a first-class Kubernetes citizen.
    With that practical foundation in place, we will discuss the SRE ideas from which
    Operators derive and the goals they share: reducing operations effort and cost,
    increasing service reliability, and spurring innovation by freeing teams from
    repetitive maintenance work.'

- en: The Operator pattern emerged at [CoreOS](https://coreos.com) as a way to automate
    increasingly complex applications on Kubernetes clusters, including managing Kubernetes
    itself and the [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) key-value store at its heart.
    Work on Operators continued through an acquisition by Red Hat, leading to the
    2018 release of the open source Operator Framework and SDK. The examples in this
    book use the Red Hat Operator SDK and the distribution mechanisms that join it
    in the Operator Framework.

- en: A community has grown up around Operators, with more than a hundred Operators
    for an array of applications from many vendors and projects available in Red Hat’s
    distribution channels alone. Several other Operator construction tools exist.
    We won’t discuss them in detail, but after you read this book you’ll be able to
    compare any of them with the Operator SDK and Framework. Other open source tools
    available for building Operators include [Kopf](https://oreil.ly/JCL-S) for Python,
    [Kubebuilder](https://oreil.ly/8zdbj) from the Kubernetes project, and the [Java
    Operator SDK](https://oreil.ly/yXhVg).
