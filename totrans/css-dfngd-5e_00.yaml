- en: If you are a web designer or document author interested in sophisticated page
    styling, improved accessibility, and saving time and effort, this book is for
    you. All you really need to know before starting the book is HTML 4.0\. The better
    you know HTML, the better prepared you’ll be, but it is not a requirement. You
    will need to know very little else to follow this book.

- en: This fifth edition of the book was finished at the end of 2022 and does its
    best to reflect the state of CSS at that time. Anything covered in detail either
    had wide browser support at the time of writing or was known to be coming soon
    after publication. CSS features that were still being developed or were known
    to have support dropping soon are not covered here.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout this book, boxes explain a given CSS property’s details, including
    which values are permitted. This content has been reproduced practically verbatim
    from the CSS specifications, but some explanation of the syntax is in order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The allowed values for each property are listed with a syntax like the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Value:** <*`family-name`*>#'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Value:** [ <*`background`*>, ]* <*`background-color`*>'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any italicized words between `<` and `>` give a type of value, or a reference
    to another property’s values. For example, the property `font` accepts values
    that originally belong to the property `font-family`. This is denoted by using
    the text <*`font-family`*>. Similarly, if a value type like a color is permitted,
    it will be represented using <*`color`*>.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Any words presented in `constant width` are keywords that must appear literally,
    without quotes. The forward slash (`/`) and the comma (,) must also be used literally.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Components of a value definition can be combined in numerous ways:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two or more keywords strung together with only space separating them means that
    all of them must occur in the given order. For example, `help me` would mean that
    the property must use those keywords in that order.
  prefs:

- en: If a vertical bar separates alternatives (*`X`* | *`Y`*), any one of them must
    occur, but only one. Given [ *`X`* | *`Y`* | *`Z`* ] any one of *`X`*, *`Y`*,
    or *`Z`* is permitted.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'A vertical double bar (*`X`* ‖ *`Y`*) means that *`X`*, *`Y`*, or both must
    occur, but they may appear in any order. Thus: *`X`*, *`Y`*, *`X`* *`Y`*, and
    *`Y`* *`X`* are all valid interpretations.'

    valid interpretations.'

    `do this` means that the words `please`, `help`, and `me` can appear in any order,
    though each appear only once. The words `do this` must always appear, in that
    order. Here are some examples: `please help me do this`, `help me please do this`,
    `me please help do this`.'

- en: 'Every component or bracketed group may (or may not) be followed by one of these
    modifiers:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An asterisk (*) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated
    zero or more times. Thus, `bucket`* means that the word `bucket` can be used any
    number of times, including zero. There is no upper limit defined on the number
    of times it can be used.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A plus (+) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is repeated
    one or more times. Thus, `mop`+ means that the word `mop` must be used at least
    once, and potentially many more times.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A hash sign (#), formally called an octothorpe, indicates that the preceding
    value or bracketed group is repeated one or more times, separated by commas as
    needed. Thus, `floor`# can be `floor` or `floor, floor, floor`, and so on. This
    is most often used in conjunction with bracketed groups or value types.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A question mark (?) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group is
    optional. For example, [`pine tree`]? means that the words `pine tree` need not
    be used (although they must appear in that order if they are used).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An exclamation point (!) indicates that the preceding value or bracketed group
    is required, and thus must result in at least one value, even if the syntax would
    seem to indicate otherwise. For example, [ `what`? `is`? `happening`? ]! must
    be at least one of the three terms marked optional.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A pair of numbers in curly braces ({*M*,*N*}) indicates that the preceding value
    or bracketed group is repeated at least *M* and at most *N* times. For example,
    `ha`{1,3} means that there can be one, two, or three instances of the word `ha`.

    For example, `give liberty`, `give me`, `liberty me give`, and `give me liberty`
    are all valid interpretations.

- en: '[ `I` | `am` ]? `the` ‖ `walrus`'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Either the word `I` or `am` may be used, but not both, and use of either is
    optional. In addition, either `the` or `walrus`, or both, must follow in any order.
    Thus you could construct `I the walrus`, `am walrus the`, `am the`, `I walrus`,
    `walrus the`, and so forth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`koo`+ `ka-choo`'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One or more instances of `koo` must be followed by `ka-choo`. Therefore `koo
    koo ka-choo`, `koo koo koo ka-choo`, and `koo ka-choo` are all legal. The number
    of `koo`s is potentially infinite, although there are bound to be implementation-specific
    limits.
  prefs: []

    `Safari` | `Chrome` ]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The all-purpose web designer’s opinion expresser. This can be interpreted as
    `I love Firefox`, `I really love Microsoft`, and similar expressions. Anywhere
    from zero to four `really`s may be used, though they may *not* be separated by
    commas. You also get to pick between `love` and `hate`, which really seems like
    some sort of metaphor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`It’s a` [ `mad` ]# `world`'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This gives the opportunity to put in as many comma-separated `mad`s as possible,
    with a minimum of one `mad`. If there is only one `mad`, no comma is added. Thus:
    `It’s a mad world` and `It’s a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world` are both valid results.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[ [ `Alpha` ‖ `Baker` ‖ `Cray` ], ]{2,3} `and Delphi`'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two to three of `Alpha`, `Baker`, and `Delta` must be followed by `and Delphi`.
    One possible result would be `Cray, Alpha, and Delphi`. In this case, the comma
    is placed because of its position within the nested bracket groups. (Some older
    versions of CSS enforced comma separation this way, instead of via the `#` modifier.)

    CSS specifications. Without the members of the CSS Working Group—past, current,
    and future—we would have no specifications, no standards, and no cross-browser
    compatibility. I am in awe of the thought process that goes into every CSS property
    and value added to, and omitted from, the specification. People like Tab Atkins,
    Elika Etimad, Dave Baron, Léonie Watson, and Greg Whitworth not only work on the
    specification, but also take their time to answer questions and explain nuances
    to the broader CSS public, notably me.

    diverse than most: it actually had a woman on it. Looking around the room, I knew
    things needed to change, and I realized it was something I needed to do. What
