<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>DevOps</h1>


<p>Developing, testing, and deploying cloud native applications differs significantly from traditional development and operations practices. In this chapter, you learn the fundamentals of DevOps along with the proven practices, including all of the benefits and challenges of developing, testing, and operating cloud native applications. Additionally, we cover designing cloud native applications with operations and rapid, reliable development processes in mind. Most concepts and patterns explained in this chapter are applicable to both containerized services and functions. When this is not the case, we explicitly call out the differences.</p>

<h1>What Is DevOps?</h1>

<p>DevOps is a broad concept that encompasses multiple aspects of collaboration and communication between software developers and other IT professionals. The easiest way to define DevOps is to talk about its goals. DevOps is intended to improve collaboration between development and operations teams throughout the entire process of software development, from planning to delivery, to improve deployment frequency, achieve faster time to market, lower the failure rate of new releases, shorten lead time between fixes, and improve mean time to recovery.</p>

<p>One of the models you can use when talking about DevOps is called CALMS, which stands for Collaboration, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing. The CALMS model is a method that we can use to assess, analyze, and compare the maturity of the DevOps team.</p>
