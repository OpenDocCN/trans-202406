- en: This book is for developers who want to learn the React library while learning
    the latest techniques currently emerging in the JavaScript language. This is an
    exciting time to be a JavaScript developer. The ecosystem is exploding with new
    tools, syntax, and best practices that promise to solve many of our development
    problems. Our aim with this book is to organize these techniques so you can get
    to work with React right away. We’ll get into state management, React Router,
    testing, and server rendering, so we promise not to introduce only the basics
    and then throw you to the wolves.

- en: This book does not assume any knowledge of React at all. We’ll introduce all
    of React’s basics from scratch. Similarly, we won’t assume that you’ve worked
    with the latest JavaScript syntax. This will be introduced in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#javascript-for-react)
    as a foundation for the rest of the chapters.

- en: You’ll be better prepared for the contents of the book if you’re comfortable
    with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s almost always best to be comfortable with
    these big three before diving into a JavaScript library.

- en: 'Our journey with React wouldn’t have started without some good old-fashioned
    luck. We used YUI when we created the training materials for the full-stack JavaScript
    program we taught internally at Yahoo. Then in August 2014, development on YUI
    ended. We had to change all our course files, but to what? What were we supposed
    to use on the front-end now? The answer: React. We didn’t fall in love with React
    immediately; it took us a couple hours to get hooked. It looked like React could
    potentially change everything. We got in early and got really lucky.'
