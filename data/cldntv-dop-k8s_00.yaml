- en: I was fortunate to be introduced to Kubernetes (and containers) fairly early
    in their lifetime. Whilst leading the DevOps practice for a boutique consultancy,
    I saw the potential for containers to bring huge benefits to a lot of our clients.
    That excitement and interest led me to take a role at Docker Inc., where I witnessed
    firsthand some of the incredible innovations taking shape in the burgeoning cloud
    native world.

  zh: 我很幸运早期接触了Kubernetes（和容器）。在领导精品咨询公司的DevOps实践时，我看到容器为我们的许多客户带来巨大好处的潜力。这种兴奋和兴趣促使我加入了Docker
    Inc.，在那里我第一手见证了新兴云原生世界中正在形成的一些令人难以置信的创新。
- en: Kubernetes began to pick up steam and I moved to Heptio (founded by the creators
    of the project at Google, later acquired by VMware) to focus on helping clients
    and the community learn and deploy it successfully. Because of this experience,
    I sometimes forget that many folks are just now exploring and adopting these technologies
    and their capabilities for the first time.

  zh: Kubernetes开始流行起来，我转投到Heptio（由Google项目创始人创立，后被VMware收购），专注于帮助客户和社区成功学习和部署它。因此，有时我会忘记许多人现在才刚开始探索和采用这些技术及其功能。
- en: Recently I was working alongside a client and demonstrating the capability of
    Kubernetes to automatically provision a cloud load balancer, register the appropriate
    DNS name, and attach the relevant TLS certificate for their application to be
    publicly accessible. “That’s SO cool!” was their response to our success, and
    captures perfectly the feelings I experienced when first discovering and learning
    Kubernetes. Unfortunately, as with almost any advanced technology, it’s not all
    sunshine and roses.

  zh: 最近，我与客户合作，演示Kubernetes自动配置云负载均衡器、注册适当的DNS名称，并为他们的应用程序附加相关的TLS证书，使其可以公开访问。“太酷了！”这是他们对我们成功的反应，完美地捕捉到了我首次发现和学习Kubernetes时的感受。不过，就像几乎所有先进技术一样，它并非一帆风顺。
- en: One of the criticisms oft-leveled at Kubernetes is that it’s *complicated*,
    which (in my mind, at least!) seems to carry a negative connotation. I disagree,
    and prefer to describe it as *necessarily complex*. Kubernetes has many moving
    parts, all working together to construct an application platform that can provide
    resiliency, efficiency, and extensibility at the highest scale. It encapsulates
    shared knowledge and saves us all the time and effort of reimplementing a lot
    of the common functionality that it provides.

  zh: Kubernetes经常受到的批评之一是它*复杂*，这在我看来至少似乎带有负面含义。我不同意，并更愿意将其描述为*必要的复杂性*。Kubernetes有许多组件相互协作，构建一个能够在最高规模下提供弹性、效率和可扩展性的应用平台。它封装了共享知识，并节省了我们重新实现其提供的许多常见功能的时间和精力。
- en: However, as a new user it can be daunting to choose where to dive in with such
    a vast array of functionality, not to mention the plethora of associated tools
    that exist in the wider cloud native ecosystem. For this reason, one of my favorite
    things about *Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes* is that the authors have assumed
    no prior knowledge. This really is a volume I would have loved in this space when
    I was starting out, awestruck and bewildered at the vast possibilities in front
    of me!

  zh: 然而，作为新用户，选择从何处着手可能令人望而却步，尤其是在如此庞大的功能阵列中，更不用说广泛的云原生生态系统中存在的大量关联工具了。因此，我最喜欢《Cloud
    Native DevOps with Kubernetes》的一点是作者假定读者没有先前的知识。这确实是我在刚开始时希望有的一本书，在面对我面前广阔可能性时既敬畏又困惑！
- en: Once you flip the page, you’ll begin by understanding the historical and cultural
    context behind DevOps and Kubernetes before being introduced to practical examples
    that are easy to follow and directly relevant to implementing these technologies
    in real-world scenarios. Therefore, whereas some titles are more reference-like
    in their approach, I recommend that you read this book in order.

  zh: 一旦你翻开书页，你将首先了解DevOps和Kubernetes背后的历史和文化背景，然后介绍易于理解且与在实际场景中实施这些技术直接相关的实际示例。因此，虽然某些标题更像是参考书，但我建议您按顺序阅读本书。
- en: Justin and John have done a great job crafting a narrative that builds on what
    has come before. New concepts are deployed in a layered way, allowing you to “explore”
    them in greater depth as you progress. Even so, upon completing the book it can
    absolutely be used as a concise reference to key everyday concepts that you’ll
    find yourself turning to over and over again.

  zh: 贾斯汀和约翰在书中的叙述构建在前人基础之上，做得非常好。新概念以逐层方式展开，使你能够随着进展“探索”它们更深入。尽管如此，在完成本书后，它绝对可以作为关键日常概念的简明参考，你会发现自己一次又一次地求助于它们。
- en: Owing to a balanced mix of hands-on examples and pragmatic business advice,
    I often find myself recommending this book as the “one-stop shop” to prime both
    architects and engineers with the knowledge they need to understand the cloud
    native landscape and start their journey toward deploying a successful Kubernetes
    application platform.

  zh: 凭借实际示例和务实的业务建议的均衡混合，我经常推荐这本书作为"一站式"指南，以帮助架构师和工程师掌握他们在理解云原生环境和开始部署成功的 Kubernetes
    应用平台过程中所需的知识。
- en: The first edition of *Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes* was released over
    three years ago, a veritable lifetime in the cloud native technology space. Not
    only have existing technologies and paradigms evolved (and in some cases been
    deprecated), but new ones have emerged. Building on the first edition, Justin
    has again applied his extensive hands-on experience to enhance the original guidance
    while maintaining the great combination of sound advice, breadth of coverage,
    and practical examples.

  zh: 《Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes》的第一版发布已经超过三年了，在云原生技术领域，这几乎是一个世纪。不仅现有技术和范式发生了演变（在某些情况下被废弃），而且还出现了新技术。在第一版的基础上，贾斯汀再次运用他丰富的实际经验，增强了原始指导，同时保持了建议的合理性、覆盖的广度和实际示例的精彩结合。
- en: My experience has taught me that there is no such thing as “best practice,”
    and that every situation is driven by nuanced constraints, which can prove challenging
    to negotiate. Justin’s experience as a practitioner working with these tools *on
    a daily basis* shines through in every section and will help you navigate the
    inevitable trade-offs and tough decisions as you choose what to adopt, and the
    best way of doing so, for your organization and/or use-cases.

  zh: 我的经验告诉我，并不存在所谓的“最佳实践”，每种情况都受到微妙约束的驱动，这可能会带来挑战。贾斯汀在与这些工具的日常实践中积累的经验在每一节中都闪耀出来，并将帮助你在选择要采纳的东西以及组织和/或用例的最佳实现方式时，应对不可避免的权衡和艰难决策。
- en: If you’re reading this book then I am assuming you are near the start of your
    DevOps and Kubernetes journey. Allow me to congratulate you for taking your first
    steps; you are in for a rewarding and exhilarating ride!
