- en: The patterns in this category cover more complex topics that do not fit in any
    of the other categories. Some of the patterns here such as *Controller* or *Operator*
    are timeless, and Kubernetes itself is built on them. However, some of the other
    pattern implementations are still evolving. To keep up with this, we will keep
    our [online examples](https://oreil.ly/p5EwH) up to date and reflect the latest
    developments in this space.
