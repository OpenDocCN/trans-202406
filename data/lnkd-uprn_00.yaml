- en: 'Many cloud native practitioners seem to have in mind that meshes are frightening,
    complex things, things to be avoided until examined as a last resort to save a
    dying application. We’d love to change that: service meshes are incredible tools
    for making developing and operating cloud native applications dramatically easier
    than it would otherwise be.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And, of course, we think Linkerd is the best mesh out there at making things
    easy for people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if you’ve been tearing your hair out trying to understand a misbehaving application
    based just on its logs, or if you’ve spent months trying to get some other mesh
    running and you *just want things to work*, or if you’re trying to explain to
    yet another developer why they really don’t need to worry about coding retries
    and mTLS into their microservice…you’re in the right place. We’re glad you’re
    here.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is meant to help anyone who thinks it’s easier to get things done
    when creating, running, or debugging microservices applications, and is looking
    to Linkerd to help with that. While we think that the book will benefit people
    who are interested in Linkerd for its own sake, Linkerd—like computing itself—is
    ultimately a means, not an end. This book reflects that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beyond that, it doesn’t matter to us whether you’re an application developer,
    a cluster operator, a platform engineer, or whatever; there should be something
    in here to help you get the most out of Linkerd. Our goal is to give you everything
    you need to get Linkerd up and running to help you get things done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You’ll need some basic knowledge of Kubernetes, the overall concept of running
    things in containers, and the Unix command line to get the most out of this book.
    Some familiarity with Prometheus, Helm, Jaeger, etc. will also be helpful, but
    isn’t really critical.

- en: Why We Wrote This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We’ve both worked in the cloud native world for years and in software for many
    more years before that. Across all that time, the challenge that has never gone
    away is education; the coolest new thing on the block isn’t much good until people
    really, truly understand what it is and how to use it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Service meshes really should be pretty well understood by now, but of course
    every month there are people who need to sort out the latest and greatest changes
    in the meshes, and every month there are more people migrating to what is, to
    them, the entirely new cloud native world. We wrote this book, and we’ll keep
    updating it, to help all these people out.

- en: '[Chapter 1, “Service Mesh 101”](ch01.html#LUAR_service_mesh_101), is an introduction
    to service meshes: what they do, what they can help with, and why you might want
    to use one. This is a must-read for folks who aren’t familiar with meshes.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2, “Intro to Linkerd”](ch02.html#LUAR_intro_to_linkerd), takes a deep
    dive into Linkerd’s architecture and history. If you’re familiar with Linkerd
    already, this may be mostly recap.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    “Adding Workloads to the Mesh”](ch04.html#LUAR_meshing_workloads), are all about
    getting Linkerd running in a cluster and getting your application working with
    Linkerd. These two chapters cover the basic nuts and bolts of actually *using*
    Linkerd. [Chapter 5, “Ingress and Linkerd”](ch05.html#LUAR_ingress_and_linkerd),
    continues by talking about the ingress problem, how to manage it, and how Linkerd
    interacts with ingress controllers.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6, “The Linkerd CLI”](ch06.html#LUAR_cli), talks about the `linkerd`
    CLI, which you can use to control and examine a Linkerd deployment.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7, “mTLS, Linkerd, and Certificates”](ch07.html#LUAR_mtls_and_certs),
    dives deep into Linkerd mTLS and the way it uses X.509 certificates. [Chapter 8,
    “Linkerd Policy: Overview and Server-Based Policy”](ch08.html#LUAR_server_policy),
    and [Chapter 9, “Linkerd Route-Based Policy”](ch09.html#LUAR_route_policy), continue
    by exploring how Linkerd can use those mTLS identities to enforce policy in your
    cluster.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 10, “Observing Your Platform with Linkerd”](ch10.html#LUAR_observability),
    is all about Linkerd’s application-wide observability mechanisms. [Chapter 11,
    “Ensuring Reliability with Linkerd”](ch11.html#LUAR_reliability), in turn, covers
    how to use Linkerd to improve reliability within your application, and [Chapter 12,
    “Multicluster Communication with Linkerd”](ch12.html#LUAR_multicluster), talks
    about extending a Linkerd mesh across multiple Kubernetes clusters.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 13, “Linkerd CNI Versus Init Containers”](ch13.html#LUAR_cni_vs_init_containers),
    addresses the thorny topic of how, exactly, you’ll have Linkerd interact with
    the low-level networking configuration of your cluster. Unfortunately, this may
    be a necessary topic of discussion as you consider taking Linkerd to production,
    which is the topic of [Chapter 14, “Production-Ready Linkerd”](ch14.html#LUAR_production_ready).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, [Chapter 15, “Debugging Linkerd”](ch15.html#LUAR_troubleshooting),
    discusses how to troubleshoot Linkerd itself, should you find things misbehaving
    (even though we hope you won’t!).
