- en: 'In [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#chapter_d1e521) we provide background on MongoDB:
    why it was created, the goals it is trying to accomplish, and why you might choose
    to use it for a project. We go into more detail in [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#chapter-2),
    which provides an introduction to the core concepts and vocabulary of MongoDB.
    [Chapter 2](ch02.xhtml#chapter-2) also provides a first look at working with MongoDB,
    getting you started with the database and the shell. The next two chapters cover
    the basic material that developers need to know to work with MongoDB. In [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#chapter-3),
    we describe how to perform those basic write operations, including how to do them
    with different levels of safety and speed. [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#chapter_d1e3559)
    explains how to find documents and create complex queries. This chapter also covers
    how to iterate through results and gives options for limiting, skipping, and sorting
    results.'

    index your MongoDB collections. [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#chapter-idx-types) explains
    how to use several special types of indexes and collections. [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#chapter_d1e6036)
    covers a number of techniques for aggregating data with MongoDB, including counting,
    finding distinct values, grouping documents, the aggregation framework, and writing
    these results to a collection. [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#chapter-transactions) introduces
    transactions: what they are, how best to use them for your application, and how
    to tune. Finally, this section finishes with a chapter on designing your application:
    [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#chapter-app-design) goes over tips for writing an application
    that works well with MongoDB.'
