    in the technology industry. In this adventure, you’re part of a fellowship led
    by a brave duo who have dared the mountains, depths, and lakes of data for decades.
    You’ll journey with Patrick McFadin and Jeff Carpenter, along with a band of visionary
    practitioners, to attain the prize: the power to create the future of data.'

    bring others along with you to go beyond the old world of computation, ruled by
    infrastructure, into the new world of cognition, ruled by autonomous experiences.
    It’s going to be awesome.

- en: The book you hold is written in a time when we’ve already seen a significant
    change in how we imagine, understand, and operate large-scale systems. The act
    of writing a book about technology in the midst of all this change may itself
    seem quixotic, but it’s essential. It’s a moment to stop at the Last Homely House
    as we gather the cognitive tools, supplies, and artifacts that will help us in
    the journey ahead.

    to clouds. Each new era feels like a new world with new rules and new opportunities.
    We build ecosystems of tools to match the era; the tools enable faster progress,
    and we build even more of them; we grow unsatisfied despite the speed, and suddenly
    there is a new breakthrough that heralds another new era.

    data. At each leap forward, they all need to transform. Mainframes and terminals,
    networks and routers, data centers and virtualization, clouds and containers;
    by architecting for new levels of abundance, each sets a new bar for velocity,
    scale, and unit economics. We strive to go faster, bigger, and more efficient.'

    wave of abundance, from the mainframe high priests to overworked network admins
    to dutiful datacenter operators to savvy cloud engineers. Infrastructure has always
    been considered expensive since it’s a cost of doing business rather than the
    business itself; each era’s technology teams have needed to focus on what the
    business values.

    and ecommerce, clouds and apps—each era’s north star reflects the standard business
    focus of the time. As we look into the near future, we see new nouns: edges, models,
    predictions, and decisions, collectively powering autonomous businesses.'

    singular global-scale federated datacenters using virtual machines and infrastructure
    microservices, designed and evolved together as one unique whole. No two of these
    clouds are alike. They vary by aesthetic, by identity models, by billing systems,
    by APIs. Just like in the beginnings of the mainframe, network, and datacenter
    eras, each cloud stack was vertically integrated. This lock-in offered great utility
    at the price of never leaving.'

    of tools, all built on the same premise: the unit of work is a container, not
    a virtual machine, physical server, or mainframe processor. Containers are the
    law of the land, representing the standard granularity of technology workloads
    until the next era comes along. It’s about transcending single clouds to gain
    a cloud native stance anywhere. The Kubernetes breakthrough is named *cloud native*
    to mark the mature state of the cloud era.'

    that scaling out our ideas requires scaling down our units of work. Software is
    made of ideas; fluidity requires scaling down to fit these ideas into more efficient
    units, and leverage requires scaling out to take advantage of any available infrastructure.'

    ecosystem has taken us a long way toward the future, but we now find ourselves
    pinned in place, short of the summit we aspire to. For all the advances we’ve
    made, they are focused on stateless operations. We now face the final stage of
    the era: cloud native data.'

- en: When we conquer this challenge collectively, we’ll have created a world where
    any app or model can run anywhere it’s needed, at the speed that users demand,
    because the data will flow with it. Whether it’s on a phone, a car, a metro edge,
    a cloud, or a satellite, the data will be self-describing, observable, fluid,
    and accessible. Infrastructure can become invisible and deliver power however
    developers may dream.

    The ordinary world of storage and StatefulSets leads you to mastery of architecting
    data infrastructure for any given workload, from applications to analytics and
    machine learning. The door to the extraordinary world will then be open to you:
    a vision of the next generation of data management and the open source projects
    that are advancing the art of the possible. Open communities sharing ideas and
    code together are the only way we can realize this future.'

    we use will be named, but we do know that they will be built on the ideas we’re
    making real now. Welcome to the adventure of cloud native data, and take joy in
    the journey!
