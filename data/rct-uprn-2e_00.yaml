    helping you feel 100% “aaah!” The place: Los Angeles; the year: 2000-something.
    I was just getting ready to FTP my new little web app called CSSsprites.com to
    my server and release it to the world. I contemplated a problem on the last few
    evenings I spent working on the app: why on earth did it take 20% effort to wrap
    up the “meat” of the app and then 80% to wrestle with the user interface? How
    many other tools could I have made if I didn’t have to `getElementById()` all
    the time and worry about the state of the app? (Is the user done uploading? What,
    an error? Is this dialog still on?) Why is UI development so time consuming? And
    what’s up with all the different browsers? Slowly, the “aaah” was turning into
    “aarrggh!”'

    is ready to announce a complete rewrite of two web apps: our third-party comments
    offering and a moderation tool to go with it. Compared to my little CSSsprites.com
    app, these were fully fledged web apps with tons more features, way more power,
    and insane amounts of traffic. Yet, the development was a joy. Teammates new to
    the app (and some even new to JavaScript and CSS) were able to come and contribute
    a feature here and an improvement there, picking up speed quickly and effortlessly.
    As one member of the team said, “Ah-ha, now I see what all the love is all about!”'

- en: React is a library for building UIs—it helps you define the UI once and for
    all. Then, when the state of the app changes, the UI is rebuilt to *react* to
    the change and you don’t need to do anything extra. After all, you’ve defined
    the UI already. Defined? More like *declared*. You use small, manageable *components*
    to build a large, powerful app. No more spending half of your function’s body
    hunting for DOM nodes; all you do is maintain the state of your app (with a regular
    old JavaScript object) and the rest just follows.

    native controls, not native-looking copies) using the same ideas of building components
    and UIs. It’s not about “write once, run everywhere” (our industry keeps failing
    at this); it’s about “learn once, use everywhere.”

- en: About This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on learning React from a web development point of view. For
    the first three chapters, you start with nothing but a blank HTML file and keep
    building up from there. This allows you to focus on learning React and not any
    of the new syntax or auxiliary tools.

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch5) focuses more on JSX, which is a separate and optional
    technology that is usually used in conjunction with React.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: From there you learn about what it takes to develop a real-life app and the
    additional tools that can help you along the way. The book uses `create-react-app`
    to get off the ground quickly and keep discussion of auxiliary technologies to
    a minimum. The goal is to focus on React above all.
  prefs: []

- en: A controversial decision was the inclusion of *class* components in addition
    to *function* components. Function components are likely the way forward; however,
    the reader is likely to encounter existing code and tutorials that talk only about
    class components. Knowing both syntaxes doubles the chances of reading and understanding
    code in the wild.
