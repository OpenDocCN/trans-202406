- en: Developing, testing, and deploying cloud native applications differs significantly
    from traditional development and operations practices. In this chapter, you learn
    the fundamentals of DevOps along with the proven practices, including all of the
    benefits and challenges of developing, testing, and operating cloud native applications.
    Additionally, we cover designing cloud native applications with operations and
    rapid, reliable development processes in mind. Most concepts and patterns explained
    in this chapter are applicable to both containerized services and functions. When
    this is not the case, we explicitly call out the differences.

  zh: 什么是DevOps？
- en: DevOps is a broad concept that encompasses multiple aspects of collaboration
    and communication between software developers and other IT professionals. The
    easiest way to define DevOps is to talk about its goals. DevOps is intended to
    improve collaboration between development and operations teams throughout the
    entire process of software development, from planning to delivery, to improve
    deployment frequency, achieve faster time to market, lower the failure rate of
    new releases, shorten lead time between fixes, and improve mean time to recovery.

  zh: DevOps是一个广泛的概念，涵盖了软件开发人员与其他IT专业人员之间多个方面的协作和沟通。定义DevOps最简单的方法是谈论其目标。DevOps旨在改善开发和运维团队在整个软件开发过程中的协作，从规划到交付，以提高部署频率，实现更快的上市时间，降低新版本的失败率，缩短修复时间，提高恢复时间。
- en: One of the models you can use when talking about DevOps is called CALMS, which
    stands for Collaboration, Automation, Lean, Measurement, and Sharing. The CALMS
    model is a method that we can use to assess, analyze, and compare the maturity
    of the DevOps team.
