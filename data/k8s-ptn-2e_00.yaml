    all recognized its power to transform the way the world developed and delivered
    software. I don’t think we knew, or even hoped to believe, how quickly this transformation
    would come. Kubernetes is now the foundation for the development of portable,
    reliable systems spanning the major public clouds, private clouds, and bare-metal
    environments. However, even as Kubernetes has become ubiquitous to the point where
    you can spin up a cluster in the cloud in less than five minutes, it is still
    far less obvious to determine where to go once you have created that cluster.
    It is fantastic that we have seen such significant strides forward in the operationalization
    of Kubernetes itself, but it is only a part of the solution. It is the foundation
    on which applications will be built, and it provides a large library of APIs and
    tools for building these applications, but it does little to provide the application
    architect or developer with any hints or guidance for how these various pieces
    can be combined into a complete, reliable system that satisfies their business
    needs and goals.

    cluster can be achieved through past experience with similar systems, or via trial
    and error, this is expensive both in terms of time and the quality of systems
    delivered to our end users. When you are starting to deliver mission-critical
    services on top of a system like Kubernetes, learning your way via trial and error
    simply takes too much time and results in very real problems of downtime and disruption.

    enables you to learn from the previous experience that we have encoded into the
    APIs and tools that make up Kubernetes. Kubernetes is the by-product of the community’s
    experience building and delivering many different, reliable distributed systems
    in a variety of different environments. Each object and capability added to Kubernetes
    represents a foundational tool that has been designed and purpose-built to solve
    a specific need for the software designer. This book explains how the concepts
    in Kubernetes solve real-world problems and how to adapt and use these concepts
    to build the system that you are working on today.

- en: In developing Kubernetes, we always said that our North Star was making the
    development of distributed systems a CS 101 exercise. If we have managed to achieve
    that goal successfully, it is books like this one that are the textbooks for such
    a class. Bilgin and Roland have captured the essential tools of the Kubernetes
    developer and distilled them into segments that are easy to approach and consume.
    As you finish this book, you will become aware not just of the components available
    to you in Kubernetes but also the “why” and “how” of building systems with those
    components.
