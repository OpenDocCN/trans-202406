    hope that rather than feeling overwhelmed, you now feel equipped to more deeply
    explore the topics that interest you and build amazing things.

    to apply the things you’ve learned in this book toward making the world a better
    place. That may include taking on a new job or side project that enables a better

    to bring happiness or improve the lives of others. Whatever it may be, when you
    wield your powers for good, we are all better off.
