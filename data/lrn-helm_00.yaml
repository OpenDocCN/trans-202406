- en: Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes, the popular open source container
    management platform.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Package managers make platforms more accessible to those who use them. In order
    to use a platform like Kubernetes, you need to run software on it, and much of
    that software will be off-the-shelf or shared. Package managers like Helm enable
    you to install and start using the software quickly without needing to figure
    out how to make it run or run well on the platform, because it has already been
    packaged up in an easy-to-use manner.

- en: If you have software you want to share with others, package managers make it
    easy to do. Platforms are more useful when there is a wide variety of software
    to run on them; open source projects and companies both like to make their software
    easy to install on the platforms it runs on, and Helm makes this possible for
    Kubernetes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Package managers aren’t just for sharing and consuming others’ software, however.
    They are often an integral part of other systems, such as DevOps tooling, and
    they are used as a building block.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Virtually every modern platform has a package manager. Operating systems, programming
    languages, and cloud platforms all have package managers of some form.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this book you will learn about Helm, which provides modern package management
    for Kubernetes, and the packages, called charts, that you can use with it. You
    will learn how to use Helm, how to create packages, and how to share those packages
    with other platforms.

- en: There are a few situations where you will find this book useful.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re new to Kubernetes or want to learn how to install off-the-shelf applications,
    this book will help you learn how to do that with Helm. It is much easier and
    faster to install applications through Helm than it is to learn how to do so by
    hand with Kubernetes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you work for a company (or a project) that wants to distribute your applications
    to Kubernetes users in an easy-to-consume manner, this book will teach you how
    to do that with Helm. Being able to quickly install your application makes getting
    started easier, and Helm can help you with that.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is also for DevOps professionals who want to learn to use Kubernetes
    package management as part of their DevOps toolchains. Helm provides powerful
    and advanced features that can be used as building blocks for other automation.
    These have been used to deploy large and complex applications onto Kubernetes,
    and this book will teach you how to leverage those features.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We, the authors, are maintainers of Helm, so we set out to write a book to help
    those who have questions about it. We didn’t just want to supply the technical
    details that are often found in the documentation; we wanted to provide context
    and insight into what Helm does and why.

- en: The first three chapters introduce you to Helm and show you how to use the Helm
    client. This begins in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#introducing_helm) with an overview
    of where Helm sits within the cloud native ecosystem along with an overview of
    its architecture. Chapters [2](ch02.xhtml#Using_Helm) and [3](ch03.xhtml#beyond_the_basics_with_helm)
    address using the Helm client, beginning with installing Helm and progressing
    to advanced usage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Chapters [4](ch04.xhtml#building_a_chart) through [6](ch06.xhtml#advanced_charts)
    cover creating packages for Helm. This begins with how to create a package ([Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#building_a_chart)),
    moves into learning the template syntax ([Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#developing_templates)),
    and finishes with advanced features ([Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#advanced_charts)).
    If you want to create packages for Helm, these chapters are for you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sharing packages, including their individual release versions, is covered in
    [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#chart_repositories). Sharing is important if you are distributing
    software to others or sharing it between systems while using DevOps processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Helm can be extended, which is covered in [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#helm_plugins_and_starters).
    There are opportunities to customize Helm without needing to fork or contribute
    functionality to Helm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Two appendixes are provided with reference material. [Appendix A](app01.xhtml#appendix_a_chart_api_versions)
    provides an overview of differences between current and legacy packages, while
    [Appendix B](app02.xhtml#appendix_b_chart_respoitory_api) covers the repository
    API used for sharing packages.
