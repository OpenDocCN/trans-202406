- en: Initially, many people who were unfamiliar with Docker viewed it as some sort
    of virtualization platform, but in reality, it was the first widely accessible
    tool to build on top of a much newer technology called *containerization*. Docker
    and Linux containers have had a significant impact on a wide range of industry
    segments that include tools and technologies like Vagrant, KVM, OpenStack, Mesos,
    Capistrano, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and so on. There is something very telling
    about the list of products that have had their market share directly impacted
    by Docker, and maybe you’ve spotted it already. Looking over this list, most engineers
    would recognize that these tools span a lot of different use cases, yet all of
    these workflows have been forever changed by Docker. This is largely because Docker
    has significantly altered everyone’s expectations of how a continuous integration
    and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflow should function. Instead of each step
    involving a time-consuming process managed by specialists, most people expect
    a DevOps pipeline to be fully automated and flow from one step to the next without
    any human intervention. The technologies in that list are also generally acclaimed
    for their ability to improve productivity, and that’s exactly what has given Docker
    so much buzz. Docker sits right in the middle of some of the most enabling technologies
    of the last decade and can bring significant improvements to almost every step
    of the pipeline.

    Linux 容器对包括 Vagrant、KVM、OpenStack、Mesos、Capistrano、Ansible、Chef、Puppet 等工具和技术在内的多个行业领域产生了重大影响。关于这些产品列表的情况，说明了很多事情，也许你已经发现了。看过这份列表后，大多数工程师会认识到，这些工具涵盖了很多不同的用例，但所有这些工作流程都已经被
    Docker 彻底改变。这主要是因为 Docker 显著改变了每个人对持续集成和持续交付（CI/CD）工作流程应该如何运作的期望。与每个步骤都涉及由专家管理的耗时过程不同，大多数人希望
    DevOps 流水线能够完全自动化，并在一个步骤到下一个步骤之间流畅无阻地进行。该列表中的技术通常也因其提高生产力的能力而广受好评，这正是使 Docker
    如此受欢迎的原因。Docker 位于过去十年中一些最具推动力的技术的核心，并且可以显著改进流水线的几乎每一个步骤。

    champion in any of these individual areas (e.g., configuration management), Docker
    would very likely look like a middling competitor. It’s stronger in some areas
    than others, but what Docker brings to the table is a feature set that crosses
    a broad range of workflow challenges. By combining the ease of application testing
    and deployment tools like Vagrant and Capistrano with the ease of administrating
    virtualization systems, and then providing interfaces that make workflow automation
    and orchestration easy to implement, Docker provides a very enabling feature set.

    to understand a lot of complexity about the environment they will be shipping
    software into, and production operations teams need to increasingly understand
    the internals of the software they ship. These are all generally good skills to
    work on because they lead to a better understanding of the environment as a whole

- en: The details of each company’s environment often require a lot of communication
    that doesn’t directly build value for the teams involved. For example, requiring
    developers to ask an operations team for release 1.2.1 of a particular library
    slows them down and provides no direct business value to the company. If developers
    could simply upgrade the version of the library they use, write their code, test
    with the new version, and ship it, the delivery time would be measurably shortened,
    and fewer risks would be involved in deploying the change. If operations engineers
    could upgrade software on the host system without having to coordinate with multiple
    teams of application developers, they could move faster. Docker helps to build
    a layer of isolation in software that reduces the burden of communication in the
    world of humans.

  zh: 每个公司环境的细节通常需要大量沟通，这些沟通并不直接为涉及的团队带来价值。例如，要求开发者向运维团队请求特定库的1.2.1版本会拖慢他们的速度，并且对公司没有直接的业务价值。如果开发者可以简单地升级他们使用的库版本，编写他们的代码，使用新版本进行测试并进行发布，交付时间将会显著缩短，并且部署变更的风险将会减少。如果运维工程师可以在不需要与多个应用开发团队协调的情况下升级主机系统上的软件，他们可以更快地进行操作。Docker有助于在软件中构建一层隔离，从而减少人类沟通的负担。
- en: Beyond helping with communication issues, Docker is opinionated about software
    architecture in a way that encourages more robustly crafted applications. Its
    architectural philosophy centers on atomic or throwaway containers. During deployment,
    the whole running environment of the old application is thrown away with it. Nothing
    in the environment of the application will live longer than the application itself,
    and that’s a simple idea with big repercussions. It means that applications are
    not likely to accidentally rely on artifacts left by a previous release. It means
    that ephemeral debugging changes are less likely to live on in future releases
    that picked them up from the local filesystem. And it means that applications
    are highly portable between servers because all of the state has to be included
    directly into the deployment artifact and be immutable, or sent to an external
    dependency like a database, cache, or file server.
  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 除了帮助解决沟通问题外，Docker 还在软件架构上持有一种鲜明的观点，鼓励构建更加健壮的应用程序。它的架构理念集中在原子或一次性容器上。在部署过程中，旧应用程序的整个运行环境会随之被丢弃。应用程序环境中的任何内容都不会比应用程序本身生存得更久，这是一个简单而有重大影响的理念。这意味着应用程序不太可能意外依赖于先前发布留下的遗物。这意味着短暂的调试更改不太可能会在未来的发布中继续存在，因为它们是从本地文件系统中获取的。这也意味着应用程序在服务器之间的可移植性很高，因为所有状态都必须直接包含在部署工件中并且是不可变的，或者发送到像数据库、缓存或文件服务器这样的外部依赖中。
- en: All of this leads to applications that are not only more scalable but more reliable
    as well. Instances of the application container can come and go with little impact
    on the uptime of the frontend site. These are proven architectural choices that
    have been successful for non-Docker applications, but the design choices enforced
    by Docker mean that containerized applications are *required* to follow these
    best practices. And that’s a very good thing.

    和基于 Windows 的工作站上运行 Linux 软件的过程。由类似 Vagrant 管理的虚拟机协助的开发者试图避免常见的“在我的机器上可以运行”的情况，即开发者的软件能正常运行，但在其他地方可能运行不正常。然而，与之前的例子一样，当你开始充分利用
    Docker 时，就不再需要在开发中模仿各种生产系统，因为大多数生产系统将只是 Linux 容器服务器，可以轻松地在本地复制。

  zh: 工作负载管理工具（Mesos、Kubernetes、Swarm等）。
- en: An orchestration layer (including the built-in Swarm mode) must be used to coordinate
    work across a pool of Linux container hosts, track the current state of all the
    hosts and their resources, and keep an inventory of running containers. These
    systems are designed to automate the regular tasks that are needed to keep a production
    cluster healthy while also providing tools that help make the highly dynamic nature
    of containerized workloads easier for human beings to interact with.

  zh: 必须使用一个编排层（包括内置的 Swarm 模式）来协调整个 Linux 容器主机池中的工作，跟踪所有主机及其资源的当前状态，并维护正在运行的容器清单。这些系统旨在自动化保持生产集群健康所需的常规任务，同时提供帮助人们更轻松地与容器化工作负载的高度动态性互动的工具。
- en: Each of these sections point out an important function that Docker and Linux
    containers disrupted and improved. Linux containers provide a way to run software
    in a controlled and isolated environment, while the easy-to-use command line interface
    (CLI) tooling and container image standard that Docker introduced made working
    with containers much easier and ensured that there was a repeatable way to build
    software across the whole fleet.

  zh: Docker 或 OCI 镜像
- en: Docker and OCI images consist of one or more filesystem layers and some important
    metadata that represent all the files required to run a containerized application.
    A single image can be copied to numerous hosts. An image typically has a repository
    address, a name, and a tag. The tag is generally used to identify a particular
    release of an image (e.g., *docker.io/superorbital/wordchain:v1.0.1*). A Docker
    image is any image that is compatible with the Docker toolset, while an OCI image
    is specifically an image that meets the Open Container Initiative standard and
    is guaranteed to work with any OCI-compliant tool.

  zh: Docker 和 OCI 镜像由一个或多个文件系统层和一些重要的元数据组成，这些元数据代表运行容器化应用程序所需的所有文件。单个镜像可以复制到多个主机上。一个镜像通常具有仓库地址、名称和标签。标签通常用于标识镜像的特定版本（例如
    *docker.io/superorbital/wordchain:v1.0.1*）。Docker 镜像是与 Docker 工具集兼容的任何镜像，而 OCI
    镜像特指符合 Open Container Initiative 标准且保证与任何 OCI 兼容工具一起工作的镜像。

  zh: Linux 容器
- en: This is a container that has been instantiated from a Docker or OCI image. A
    specific container can exist only once; however, you can easily create multiple
    containers from the same image. The term *Docker container* is a misnomer since
    Docker simply leverages the operating system’s container functionality.

  zh: 这是从Docker或OCI镜像实例化的容器。一个特定的容器只能存在一次；然而，你可以轻松地从同一个镜像创建多个容器。术语*Docker容器*是一个误称，因为Docker只是利用操作系统的容器功能。
