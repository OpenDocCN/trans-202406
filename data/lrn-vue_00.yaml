- en: The JavaScript framework plays a significant role in modern web frontend development.
    When developing web projects, companies choose a framework for various reasons,
    including the quality of the final product, the cost of development, coding standard,
    and ease of development. Hence, learning to work with a JavaScript framework,
    such as Vue, is essential for any modern web developer (or frontend developer
    or full stack developer).

- en: This book is for programmers who want to learn and develop Web applications
    using Vue library, in JavaScript and TypeScript, from end to end. It focuses solely
    on how Vue and its ecosystem can help you build scalable and interactive web applications
    in the most straightforward and comfortable direction. While covering the basics,
    we will also get into Vue Router and Pinia for state management, testing, animation,
    deployment, and server-side rendering, making sure you are ready to move on and
    start developing complex Vue projects right away.

- en: It’s OK if you are not familiar with Vue or the concept of Virtual DOM. This
    book doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of Vue or any similar framework. I will
    introduce and guide you through all Vue’s basics from scratch. I will also walk
    you through the Virtual DOM concept and reactivity system in Vue in Chapter 2,
    as the foundation for the rest of the book.

    prepared if you are familiar with TypeScript basics. You will also be better prepared
    for the contents of the book if you have prior basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. A solid foundation of these three is always crucial before diving
    to any web (or frontend) Javascript framework.

- en: As I embarked on the journey of writing this book, my family was navigating
    a tumultuous period, full of highs and lows. Despite enjoying every moment, writing
    this book required a lot of time, effort, and dedication, and I wouldn’t be able
    to commit to it without the support from my family, particularly my husband, Natan.
    His encouragement, belief in my programming skills, humor about frontend development,
    parenting our children during my work travels, lending an ear to my daily grievances,
    and helping me balance work with personal life have been invaluable. Without Natan,
    I would not be where I am today.

    to critical technical insights and encouragement from Jakub Andrzejewski, Chris
    Fritz, Lipi Patnaik, Edward Wong, and Vishwesh Ravi Shrimali. Your valuable feedback
    has been pivotal in sharpening my focus and elevating the quality of this work.

    Quinn, for guiding me through the acquisition process of *Learning Vue*, and to
    my exceptional editor, Michele Cronin. Michele, your insightful feedback, professionalism,
    and empathy, particularly during the challenging final stages of the book, were
    extraordinary. The production editing skills of Ashley Stussy and the copyediting
    expertise of Beth Richards were crucial in elevating my manuscript to production
    quality. This book wouldn’t have materialized as envisioned without your collective
    efforts.'
